# Partnerships Department - Current State

## Executive Summary

**Status:** Pilot phase (pre-agreement)
**Model:** Authorized reseller / representative
**Active Partners:** 1 (Robertas V.P. / BIG GROUP - pending agreement)
**Territory:** EU/EEA countries + Switzerland
**Revenue Contribution:** $0 (no deals closed yet)
**Stage:** Setting up partnership model, creating collateral, preparing for first introductions

**Key Quote:**
> "After a single discovery meeting, we generate a working prototype of the proposed solution — a functional application, not a slide deck — before the prospect pays a cent. This means the prospect's internal team can see and interact with something real." — `context/01_eu-partnership-proposal.md` lines 110-114

This prototype-first approach is the core sales advantage for partners.

## Partnership Model Overview

### What It Is

Nexrizen has adopted an **authorized reseller / representative model** for expansion into EU/EEA markets. Partners identify and introduce prospective clients from their networks, and Nexrizen handles the technical sale, delivery, and support. Partners earn commission on all revenue from clients they introduce.

**Model type:** Non-exclusive reseller (initially)
**Compensation:** Success-fee based (15% commission)
**Partner role:** Relationship-based introductions, not technical selling

### Why This Model

**Reasons for choosing reseller approach:**
1. **Speed to market** - Leverage existing EU executive networks without building sales team
2. **Trust dynamics** - Warm introductions from trusted advisors have higher conversion than cold outreach
3. **Local knowledge** - Partners understand cultural, regulatory, and business norms in their territories
4. **Low overhead** - No salaries, office costs, or fixed expenses
5. **Aligned incentives** - Partners only earn when Nexrizen earns

**Quote from proposal:**
> "Your reputation with your network is paramount — we understand that you are putting your name behind our work, and we take that seriously." — `context/01_eu-partnership-proposal.md` lines 367-368

### What Partners Do (Scope)

**Authorized activities:**
- Identify potential clients from existing professional network
- Make warm introductions via email, call, or in-person meeting
- Describe Nexrizen's general capabilities using approved materials
- Participate in sales meetings and calls when appropriate
- Provide market context (industry norms, buyer expectations, competitive landscape)

**NOT authorized (per `context/04_nexrizen-reseller-agreement.md` §2.4):**
- Enter contracts on behalf of Nexrizen
- Quote specific prices without prior written approval
- Make representations beyond approved marketing materials
- Collect payments from clients
- Represent themselves as employees or agents with binding authority

### What Nexrizen Does

**Nexrizen responsibilities:**
- Run discovery calls and scope projects
- Create proposals and estimates
- Build and deliver working prototypes (often before contract)
- Handle all engineering, project management, and client communication during delivery
- Provide sales support (participate in calls, answer technical questions)
- Create and maintain approved marketing materials for partner use
- Track attribution and pay commissions
- Maintain confidentiality and professional standards

**Key advantage:**
> "Our internal operations run on the same AI systems we build for clients. We use proprietary tools that ingest every meeting, document, and communication to maintain perfect continuity across projects." — `context/01_eu-partnership-proposal.md` lines 374-377

This AI-native operations model enables faster turnaround than traditional agencies.

## Commission Structure

### Rates and Terms

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Commission rate** | 15% of collected revenue |
| **Basis** | Cash received from client (not contract value) |
| **Payment timing** | Within 30 days of Nexrizen receiving client payment |
| **Payment method** | Wire transfer (EUR or USD, partner's preference) |
| **Attribution period** | Initial engagement + any follow-on work within 12 months of introduction |
| **Minimum deal size** | None (typical engagements: $3K-$50K+) |
| **Exclusions** | Clients who contact Nexrizen independently (not through partner introduction) |

**Source:** `context/01_eu-partnership-proposal.md` lines 123-147 and `context/04_nexrizen-reseller-agreement.md` §3

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Single project**
- Partner introduces fintech company
- Client engages for $25,000 dashboard project
- Commission earned: $3,750 (15%)

**Scenario 2: Multiple engagements**
- Partner introduces same fintech company
- Initial project: $25,000 (commission: $3,750)
- 6 months later, client returns: $15,000 (commission: $2,250)
- **Total from one introduction: $6,000**

**Scenario 3: Fractional CTO retainer**
- Partner introduces startup
- Client engages at $10,000/month for 12 months
- Total revenue: $120,000
- **Commission: $18,000 over 12 months ($1,500/month)**

### Attribution Rules

**How attribution is established:**
1. Partner sends email to Nexrizen identifying: company name, contact person, brief context
2. Nexrizen confirms receipt and attribution status within 5 business days
3. Attribution holds for 12 months from date of introduction
4. If Nexrizen has pre-existing relationship, partner is notified within 5 days (no commission)
5. If multiple sources introduce same client, attribution goes to first qualified introduction

**Source:** `context/04_nexrizen-reseller-agreement.md` §4

**"Qualified Introduction" definition (§1.1):**
- Prospective client was not previously known to Nexrizen
- Partner provides written notice within 48 hours of introduction
- Prospect is bona fide business entity with decision-making authority

### Commission Tracking

**Current tooling:** Manual (email-based attribution, manual invoicing)
**Planned improvement:** Automated commission tracking system in Notion or dedicated tool

**Reporting cadence:**
- Monthly statements showing: referred clients with active engagements, payments received, commissions earned/paid
- Quarterly review of total partnership performance

**Partner involvement:**

- Sometimes: Participate in proposal presentation (if client requests or relationship warrants)
- Rarely: Involved in delivery (Nexrizen handles)

**Key advantage for partner:**

## Current Gaps and Limitations

### What We Don't Know Yet

**No historical data:**
- ⚠️ No partnership deals closed yet (pilot phase)
- ⚠️ No data on conversion rates for partner-sourced leads
- ⚠️ No data on average deal size or sales cycle length via channel
- ⚠️ No data on which verticals convert best

**No competitive intelligence:**
- ⚠️ Don't know typical reseller commission rates in EU B2B software market
- ⚠️ Don't know how competitors structure channel partnerships
- ⚠️ Don't know if 15% is competitive or low/high

**Limited collateral produced:**
- ✅ One-pager content complete (v2.0, ready for design execution)
- ⚠️ Case study collection needs formatting (content exists in business-core/)
- ⚠️ Capability sheets, presentation deck, email templates still in planning phase
- ⚠️ Can't fully enable partner until all priority materials are designed/formatted

**Legal/tax unknowns:**
- ⚠️ Tax implications of US-EU reseller payments (need accountant review)
- ⚠️ Whether Robertas operates as individual or BIG GROUP entity (to be clarified)
- ⚠️ Payment method preferences (wire, Wise, PayPal, other)

### Operational Gaps

**Commission tracking:**
- Currently: Manual (email-based attribution)
- Needed: Automated tracking system
- Needed: Clear process for monthly statements

**Partner enablement:**
- Currently: No formal onboarding process
- Needed: Onboarding checklist, training materials
- Needed: Ongoing partner communication cadence

**Performance metrics:**
- Currently: No KPIs defined
- Needed: Target number of introductions per quarter
- Needed: Target conversion rate, average deal size, sales cycle length benchmarks

**CRM integration:**
- Currently: No dedicated partner portal
- Needed: Way for partners to see status of their leads
- Needed: Commission statement access

## Success Metrics (To Be Tracked)

**Once partnership is active, track:**

**Activity metrics:**
- Number of introductions per quarter
- Number of discovery calls conducted

**Conversion metrics:**
- Introduction → Discovery call rate
- Discovery call → Prototype rate
- Prototype → Signed contract rate
- Overall introduction → Closed deal rate

**Revenue metrics:**
- Total revenue from partner channel
- Average deal size
- Commission paid
- Customer lifetime value (do referred clients return?)

**Operational metrics:**
- Time from introduction to first discovery call
- Time from discovery to prototype delivery
- Time from prototype to signed contract
- Partner satisfaction (qualitative)

**Current baseline:** All metrics at zero (pre-pilot)
