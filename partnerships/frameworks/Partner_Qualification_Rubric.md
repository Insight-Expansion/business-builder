# Partner Qualification Rubric

## Purpose

Use this framework to evaluate potential partners **before** investing time in partnership development. Not every referral or inquiry should become a partnership.

**When to use:** New partner inquiry, referral, or proactive outreach

---

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Network Quality & Access ⭐

**Question:** Do they have direct access to decision-makers in our target industries?

**Scoring:**
- ✅ **Strong:** Direct relationships with C-suite, VPs, budget holders in target verticals (FinTech, healthcare, legal, e-commerce, aviation, etc.)
- ⚠️ **Moderate:** Connections exist but not at decision-maker level, or limited to one vertical
- ❌ **Weak:** Generic network, no clear access to our ICP, mostly junior contacts

**Evidence to look for:**
- Specific examples of contacts ("My cousin is VP at [Fortune 500]")
- LinkedIn profile showing executive connections
- Track record of successful introductions in past
- Industry reputation and credentials

**Weight:** Critical - Without quality network, partnership has no value

---

### 2. Geographic Fit ⭐

**Question:** Do they cover territories we want to expand into?

**Scoring:**
- ✅ **Strong:** Based in target territory (EU/EEA, specific countries), deep local knowledge
- ⚠️ **Moderate:** Some geographic overlap, or willing to focus on our target markets
- ❌ **Weak:** No geographic alignment, or territories we're not pursuing

**Current priority territories:**
- EU/EEA countries + Switzerland (high priority)
- United States (already direct, lower partner priority)
- UK, Canada, Australia (future consideration)
- Asia, LatAm (not current focus)

**Weight:** High - Geography determines deal feasibility (legal, currency, cultural fit)

---

### 3. Relationship Strength ⭐

**Question:** Can they make warm introductions, or just cold outreach?

**Scoring:**
- ✅ **Strong:** Family, long-term colleagues (10+ years), close friends, trusted advisor relationships
- ⚠️ **Moderate:** Professional network, LinkedIn connections, industry peers
- ❌ **Weak:** Plans to do cold outreach, bought contact lists, no existing relationships

**Key differentiator:**
> "People buy from people they trust. Partners with warm relationships convert 3-5x higher than cold outreach." — Partnership experience

**Evidence:**
- How they describe relationships ("my daughter", "12-year colleague", "family friend")
- Willingness to put their reputation on the line
- Track record of successful referrals

**Weight:** Critical - Warm intros are the whole point of channel partnerships

---

### 4. Lead Volume Potential ⭐

**Question:** How many qualified leads can they realistically generate?

**Scoring:**
- ✅ **Strong:** Can generate 5-10+ qualified intros per month sustainably
- ⚠️ **Moderate:** 2-5 qualified intros per month, or 10+ but uncertain quality
- ❌ **Weak:** <2 per month, one-time batch of leads, unsustainable pace

**Considerations:**
- Size of their network
- How actively they work their network (newsletter, events, proactive outreach)
- Whether they have distribution channels (LinkedIn, podcast, speaking, etc.)
- Realistic time commitment

**Balance:** High volume + low quality is worse than low volume + high quality

**Weight:** High - Need sufficient deal flow to justify partnership overhead

---

### 5. Values & Professionalism ⭐

**Question:** Do they operate with integrity and high standards?

**Scoring:**
- ✅ **Strong:** Track record of professionalism, values confidentiality, win-win mindset, high ethical standards
- ⚠️ **Moderate:** Professional but pushy, some red flags but addressable
- ❌ **Weak:** Unethical behavior, overselling, poor reputation, unreliable

**Red flags:**
- Overpromising ("I can get you 100 meetings next month")
- Pressure tactics or urgency without reason
- Reluctant to sign standard agreements
- Poor communication (ghosting, late responses)
- Bad-mouthing competitors or former partners

**Green flags:**
- Banking/Big Four/institutional background (like Robertas)
- Professional references available
- Thoughtful questions about our services and quality standards
- Realistic expectations
- Values client success over quick commission

**Quote from Robertas (example of strong values):**
> "We guarantee the collaboration with you in very good quality and good standards... highest possible level standards banking banking standards"

**Weight:** Critical - One bad partner can damage our reputation

---

### 6. Capacity & Focus ⭐

**Question:** Do they have time and resources to execute?

**Scoring:**
- ✅ **Strong:** Dedicated time, support staff (like Robertas's Angela), clear prioritization
- ⚠️ **Moderate:** Part-time focus, limited support, juggling multiple priorities
- ❌ **Weak:** No time, side project, unrealistic expectations about effort required

**Questions to ask:**
- How much time can you dedicate to this partnership weekly?
- Do you have support staff or is this just you?
- What other business priorities are you managing?
- What's your timeline expectation for first deals?

**Realistic expectation:**
- 5-10 hours/month minimum for active partnership
- More upfront (setup, learning materials, first intros)
- Less ongoing (maintenance, check-ins)

**Weight:** Medium - Better to have one focused partner than three distracted ones

---

### 7. Motivation & Alignment ⭐

**Question:** Why do they want to partner? Are our incentives aligned?

**Scoring:**
- ✅ **Strong:** Win-win mindset, wants to add value to their network, commission is secondary motivator
- ⚠️ **Moderate:** Primarily commission-driven but professional
- ❌ **Weak:** Only cares about commission, transactional, short-term thinking

**Best motivations:**
- Adding value to their network ("I want to help my contacts solve real problems")
- Building long-term strategic relationships
- Differentiating their own business (e.g., PE firm offering tech to portfolio companies)
- Learning about AI/tech landscape

**Risky motivations:**
- Quick money ("I need to make $50K this quarter")
- Desperation (laid off, business struggling)
- Testing multiple competing partnerships simultaneously

**Weight:** Medium - Motivation predicts long-term partnership health

---

## Scoring System

### Calculate Total Score

For each criterion:
- ✅ Strong = 2 points
- ⚠️ Moderate = 1 point
- ❌ Weak = 0 points

**Total possible:** 14 points (7 criteria × 2 points)

### Decision Matrix

| Score | Decision | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **12-14 points** | ✅ **Strong Partner** | Proceed immediately, high priority |
| **9-11 points** | ⚠️ **Qualified Partner** | Proceed with standard process, normal priority |
| **6-8 points** | ⚠️ **Conditional** | Pilot with 1-2 leads first, then reassess |
| **3-5 points** | ❌ **Weak** | Politely decline or suggest revisiting later |
| **0-2 points** | ❌ **Not a fit** | Pass, no further engagement |

### Critical Criteria (Must-Pass)

Even with high total score, **automatically decline if:**
- ❌ on **Network Quality** (no point without good network)
- ❌ on **Relationship Strength** (we need warm intros, not cold outreach)
- ❌ on **Values & Professionalism** (reputation risk too high)

## Example: Robertas V.P. Evaluation

**Applied retrospectively to show how rubric works:**

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Network Quality** | ✅ 2 points | 30 years finance/banking, Big Four, aviation finance, specific executive contacts named |
| **Geographic Fit** | ✅ 2 points | Based in Monaco/Luxembourg, extensive EU/EEA network, perfect territory fit |
| **Relationship Strength** | ✅ 2 points | Family (daughter, cousin), family friends, 12-year colleague - all warm |
| **Lead Volume** | ✅ 2 points | "Hundreds to thousands" of leads, can generate 10/week, LinkedIn newsletter distribution |
| **Values & Professionalism** | ✅ 2 points | Banking standards, Big Four background, confidentiality focus, win-win mindset |
| **Capacity & Focus** | ✅ 2 points | Has Angela (assistant), building new AI-focused website, dedicated time |
| **Motivation** | ✅ 2 points | Wants to add value to network, positioned as strategic partnership not just commission |

**Total: 14/14 points** → ✅ Strong Partner (highest tier)

**Decision:** Proceed immediately with high priority (which we did)

## Continuous Improvement

**Track partnership outcomes against initial scores:**

After 6 months, review:
- Did high-scoring partners perform well?
- Did we correctly identify risks in moderate-scoring partners?
- Were there criteria we should weight differently?
- Should we add/remove criteria based on learnings?

**Update rubric quarterly** based on partnership performance data.
