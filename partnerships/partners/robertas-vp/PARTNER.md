## Lead Generation Capacity

### Stated Capacity

**Robertas's estimate:**
> "We have at the moment when talking about your artificial intelligence AI products, we have on the first hand on the first brief look we have hundreds of potential leads, potential customers to introduce to you... in reality we have maybe thousands" — Robertas, 2026-02-06 meeting

> "We can in reality generate 10 per week for you leads" — Robertas, 2026-02-06 meeting

**Agreed pace:** ~5 introductions per week (to avoid overload)

**Reasoning:**
> "10 leads per week we can generate but it is overload. It will be not enough time to make video calls, conferences and everything to do everything in a good standard." — Robertas, 2026-02-06 meeting

**Nexrizen capacity assumption:**
- Conversion rate: ~20%
- 5 intros/week → ~1 closed deal/week (if conversion holds)

## Risk Mitigation

**Minimal risks identified:**

**Potential considerations:**
1. **Agreement not yet signed** - In progress, expected mid-Feb
2. **No historical performance data** - Pilot phase, will track metrics
3. **High expectations for quality** - Actually a strength; ensures we deliver well
4. **Tax optimization via Monaco** - Legitimate financial planning, not a red flag
5. **Family/relationship network** - Could be sensitive if deals go wrong (handle with extra care)

**Mitigation:**
- Deliver exceptional quality on first deals to set tone
- Over-communicate during pilot phase
- Respect confidentiality of his network (as agreed)
- Use prototype-first approach to build trust before asking for money

**Quote on trust:**
> "Already we not sign any agreements but I trust in you you trust in me I trust but that's that's information will not be used wrongfully or somehow" — Robertas, 2026-02-06 meeting
