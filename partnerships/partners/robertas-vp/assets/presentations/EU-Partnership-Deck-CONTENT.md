# Nexrizen EU Partnership Presentation Deck

**Purpose:** Presentation that Robertas can deliver independently to EU executive prospects, or that can be used as a leave-behind after meetings. Includes speaker notes for every slide so Robertas can present confidently without Nexrizen present.

**Total slides:** 13
**Estimated presentation time:** 15-20 minutes (with Q&A: 30 minutes)

## Slide 1: Title

### On Screen
**NEXRIZEN**

*We don't sell AI. We make it work for your business.*

Your Fractional AI & Technology Team

[Logo] | nexrizen.com

### Speaker Notes
"Thank you for taking this meeting. I'm here to introduce you to Nexrizen — my technology partner for AI and automation. They're an AI-native firm based in the US, founded by ex-Meta and Georgia Tech engineers, and they do something no other consultancy I've seen does: they build you a working prototype before you pay anything. I've worked in banking and finance for over 30 years — KPMG, Deloitte, PwC, EY — and I brought them on as my technology partner specifically because their approach eliminates risk for executives like you."

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### On Screen
**The Challenge You Face**

- Teams drowning in manual work
- Customer inquiries unanswered for hours
- Data trapped in disconnected systems
- Scaling = adding headcount proportionally

**What consultancies offer today:**
- Slide decks, not solutions
- 6-month timelines
- Pay advance before seeing anything

**The real cost isn't the consultancy fee — it's the months of lost productivity while you wait.**

### Speaker Notes
"Every executive I speak to has the same problem. They know they need AI and automation, but every option feels too expensive, too risky, or too slow. Traditional consultancies ask for 25,000 or 50,000 euros advance payment before showing you anything. They deliver PowerPoint presentations. Implementation takes six months. By the time the system is built, your requirements have changed. Nexrizen does the opposite."

---

## Slide 3: Who We Are

### On Screen
**Founded by Engineers, Not Salespeople**

**Weipeng Zhuo, PhD (ABD) — CEO**
- Former Meta data scientist (ML algorithms, data analytics)
- Georgia Tech (ranked #3 engineering nationally)
- Background: Genentech (biotech), terabyte-scale genomic data
- AILA Technology Innovation Award winner
- 10-year daily meditation practice — thoughtful, disciplined leadership

**Gabriel Perez — CTO**
- Serial entrepreneur: Multiple successful exits
  - Led CITYROW through WaterRower acquisition (Jan 2024)
  - Built SaaS platform acquired by Georgia Tech
- 15+ years engineering, ex-IBM
- Georgia Tech Computer Science (ranked #2 nationally in CS)

**Team:** 8 senior engineers | 100+ years combined experience
**No junior developers. No outsourcing. No layers.**

### Speaker Notes
"Both founders are hands-on engineers, not managers. Wei has a PhD background from Georgia Tech and worked at Meta doing machine learning. Gabe has led companies through successful acquisitions — he was CTO of CITYROW when it was acquired by WaterRower last year. Their team is 8 senior engineers with over 100 years of combined experience. Every project is founder-led. You deal directly with the people building your system."

---

## Slide 4: What We Build (Outcomes, Not Features)

### On Screen
**Three Pillars — Before & After**

| Pillar | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Custom Software** | Teams pull reports from 5 systems manually | Real-time dashboard, one screen, auto-updated |
| **AI & Automation** | 8-person team, 4-hour response time | AI handles 1,000+ conversations daily, instant, 24/7 |
| **Fractional CTO** | No technology leadership, reactive decisions | Strategic roadmap, technical due diligence, architecture review |

**Technology:** Python, TypeScript, React, PostgreSQL, Google Cloud Platform
**AI/ML:** OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, LangChain, custom models

### Speaker Notes
"Nexrizen builds three things. Custom software — dashboards, platforms, integrations. AI and automation systems — chatbots, document processing, workflow automation. And fractional CTO services — technology strategy, due diligence, architecture. The key difference is they focus on outcomes, not features. They don't tell you 'we'll build a React application with a PostgreSQL database.' They tell you 'your team currently spends 8 hours a day on manual data entry — after we're done, it takes zero.' That's the difference."

---

## Slide 5: How We're Different — Zero Risk

### On Screen
**1. No Advance Payment Required**

Unlike consultancies asking for advance payment before showing anything...

**Our Approach:**
After ONE discovery call, we build a working prototype.
Not a slide deck. A functional application you can interact with.
**Before any contract is signed.**

**Results:**
- 90% response rate (vs industry 5-10%)
- 75-80% conversion to paying clients
- Zero financial risk to validate capabilities

> *"Most companies ask advance payment of 25,000 or 50,000 euros... when you say we do a small example just to test it and see, that's very good. That's very risk-free. Everybody likes it."*

### Speaker Notes
"This is the most important slide. Most consultancies ask you to pay 25,000 to 50,000 euros before showing you anything. Nexrizen does the opposite. After one conversation — one 30-minute call — they build you a working prototype. Not a proposal. Not a slide deck. A real, functional application you can click through and test. And they do this before any contract is signed. This is why their response rate is 90% and their close rate is 75-80%. When people see a working prototype of their idea, they want to move forward."

## Slide 6: How We're Different — AI-Native Operations

### On Screen
**2. We Run Our Own Business on AI**

**6 Proprietary AI Systems (3 public on GitHub):**

| System | What It Does | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Proposal Builder | Auto-generates client proposals | 20-30x time reduction |
| Prototype Generator | One-click UI from requirements | Working demos in minutes |
| Dev Toolkit | Accelerated development framework | 3-12 weeks vs 6 months |
| Browser Automation | Project-specific automation | Custom per client |
| Webinar Generator | Marketing automation | Scale without headcount |
| Business Builder | AI-native operating system | Complete business automation |

**Verify our claims:** github.com/Insight-Expansion

**The AI-Native Agency Model:**
Traditional consultancies sell labor (30-40% margins).
AI-native firms deliver outcomes at dramatically higher efficiency.
We pass the savings to you through faster delivery and lower costs.

### Speaker Notes
"This is what makes Nexrizen different from every other consultancy. They don't just build AI for clients — they run their entire business on AI they built themselves. Six proprietary systems. Three of them are public on GitHub — you can go verify this yourself. Their proposal system generates client proposals 20-30 times faster than manual work. Their development toolkit is why they deliver in weeks instead of months. This isn't a marketing claim — it's verifiable technology. And this model — using AI internally to deliver outcomes more efficiently — is an emerging industry trend. Nexrizen has an 18-month head start."

## Slide 7: How We're Different — Senior Quality

### On Screen
**3. Banking-Standard Quality. Senior Engineers Only.**

Every project led directly by founders.
Ex-Meta and ex-IBM engineers with Georgia Tech backgrounds.
8 senior engineers, 100+ years combined experience.

**No junior developers. No outsourcing. No layers.**

Our EU partner (30+ years Big Four experience) chose us because his network expects institutional-quality work. We deliver.

**Result:** Senior-level expertise at every stage. Direct founder access. Big Four-level standards at startup speed.

### Speaker Notes
"I chose Nexrizen as my technology partner because my network — people like you — expects institutional-quality work. I've spent 30 years at KPMG, Deloitte, PwC, EY. I know what Big Four standards look like. Nexrizen meets those standards, but they deliver at startup speed. Every project is led by one of the two founders. There are no junior developers, no outsourcing, no layers between you and the people doing the work."

## Slide 8: Case Study Highlight #1

### On Screen
**Case Study: Fortune 100 Financial Institution**

**Challenge:** Legacy data architecture causing multi-day processing delays
**Solution:** Complete big-data architectural renovation
**Result:** **100x processing speed improvement**

**Case Study: Immigration Law Firm**

**Challenge:** Attorneys spending 1,300 hours/year on meeting summaries
**Solution:** AI meeting transcription and summarization system
**Result:** **1,300 attorney hours saved annually** | **99% time reduction** (4 hours to 10 seconds)

### Speaker Notes
"Let me share two specific examples. For a Fortune 100 financial institution, they renovated the entire data architecture and achieved a 100x processing speed improvement. For an immigration law firm, they built an AI system that automatically summarizes legal meetings — saving 1,300 attorney hours per year. What used to take 4 hours now takes 10 seconds. That's a 99% time reduction. These aren't theoretical — these are production systems running today."

---

## Slide 9: Case Study Highlight #2

### On Screen
**Case Study: Professional Services Firm**

**Challenge:** Manual workflows consuming team capacity
**Solution:** Intelligent workflow automation system
**Result:** **~$50,000 annual savings** | **3-5 hours daily eliminated**

**Case Study: CITYROW (Fractional CTO)**

**Challenge:** Startup needed technology leadership through acquisition
**Solution:** Gabriel Perez served as fractional CTO
**Result:** **Successfully acquired by WaterRower** (January 2024)

**Track Record:**
- 50+ production applications shipped
- 7,000+ users scaled (Georgia Tech platform)
- $500K+ revenue generated for clients
- AILA Technology Innovation Award

### Speaker Notes
"Two more examples. A professional services firm was losing $50,000 a year to manual workflows — 3-5 hours every day of team time wasted. Nexrizen automated it. And in the fractional CTO role, Gabe led CITYROW as CTO through a successful acquisition by WaterRower last January. This shows they don't just build software — they provide strategic technology leadership. Overall track record: 50+ production applications shipped, 7,000+ users scaled, AILA Technology Innovation Award."

## Slide 11: Your Fractional AI/Tech Team

### On Screen
**Pricing: Your Fractional AI/Tech Team at $120/hr**

| What You Expect | What We Offer | The Difference |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Senior engineers at market rate | $120/hr (~110/hr), ex-Meta & Georgia Tech PhDs | **Senior talent at 1/3 market rate** |
| Large upfront investment | Typical MVP: ~80-120 hrs (~10-14K) | **Fraction of the cost** |
| 6-month timeline | 3-6 weeks | **10x faster** |
| Advance payment required | Free prototype first | **Zero risk** |
| Full-time CTO hire | Fractional team, no minimums | **On demand** |

**The Model: Ongoing Partnership, Not One-Off Projects**
We become your fractional AI and technology team — available on demand for new projects, maintenance, strategic guidance, and scaling.

**No minimums. No long-term lock-in. Scale up or down as needed.**

### Speaker Notes
"Here's the pricing. $120 per hour — that's approximately 110 euros. For senior engineers from Meta and Georgia Tech, the market rate is 250 to 400 euros per hour. You're getting that caliber at one-third the price. A typical MVP project takes 80-120 hours — that's 9,000 to 13,000 euros, not 50,000 to 150,000. And here's the important part — you're not hiring for one project. You're getting a fractional AI and technology team. They become your ongoing technology partner. When you need a new feature, a new system, strategic guidance — they're there. No minimums, no lock-in. This is how modern companies access senior technical talent."
