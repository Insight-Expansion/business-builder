## The Challenge European Executives Face

Your teams are drowning in manual work. Customer inquiries go unanswered for hours. Data sits in disconnected systems. Scaling means adding headcount proportionally to growth — a model that doesn't scale.

**Worse:** Traditional consultancies ask €25,000-€50,000 advance payment before showing anything. They deliver slide decks. Implementation takes months. By the time the system is built, your requirements have changed.

**The real cost isn't the consultancy fee — it's the months of lost productivity while you wait.**

## What We Build — Outcomes, Not Features

### Custom Software Development

- **Before:** Teams manually pulling reports from 5 systems. **After:** Real-time operational dashboard, one screen, auto-updated.
- Database architecture for terabyte-scale data processing
- Client-facing platforms and portals
- Integration systems connecting fragmented data sources

**Technology:** Python, TypeScript, React, PostgreSQL, Google Cloud Platform

### AI & Automation Systems

## Why Nexrizen Is Different

### 1. No Advance Payment Required (Unlike €25-50K Competitors)

**The Problem:** Most European consultancies ask €25,000-€50,000 upfront before showing you anything.

**Our Approach:** After a single discovery call, we build a working prototype — **before any contract is signed**. Not a slide deck. A functional application you can interact with.

**Results:**

- 90% response rate (vs industry 5-10%)
- 75-80% conversion to paying clients
- Dramatically faster decision-making
- Zero financial risk to validate our capabilities

**As our EU partner Robertas (30+ years Big Four experience) says:**

> "Most companies ask for advance payment of 25,000 or 50,000 euros... when you say we do a small example just to test it and see, that's very good. That's very risk-free. Everybody likes it."

### 2. Complete AI-Native Technology Stack (Verifiable on GitHub)

We don't just talk about AI—we've built **6 proprietary AI systems** that run our entire business:

**System #1: Proposal Builder** - Sales & Client Acquisition

- 20-30x time reduction (5-10 hours → <1 hour for 5-6 proposals in parallel)
- Auto-ingests meetings, emails, documents for instant synthesis

**System #2: Lovable Prototype Generator** - Rapid Prototyping

- One-click UI generation from requirements
- Working demos in minutes (not days)

**System #3: ThreeDays Dev Toolkit** - Development Framework

- **Public on GitHub:** github.com/Insight-Expansion/threedays-dev-toolkit
- Why we deliver in 3-12 weeks vs industry 6 months

**System #4: Browser Automation Generator** - Project-Specific Automation

- **Public on GitHub:** github.com/Insight-Expansion/browser-automation-generator
- Creates custom automation for each client project

**System #5: Webinar Generator** - Marketing Automation

- **Public on GitHub:** github.com/Insight-Expansion/webinar-generator
- Scales marketing without scaling team

**System #6: Business Builder** - Operations (In Development)

- Complete AI-native business operating system

**Verify our claims:** 3 systems are public on GitHub. We practice what we preach.

**Why this matters — the AI-Native Agency Model:**

Traditional consultancies sell labor at 30-40% margins. AI-native firms like Nexrizen use AI internally to deliver finished outcomes at 60-80% margins — and pass the savings to clients through faster delivery and lower costs. This isn't just our approach; it's an emerging industry transformation. We have an 18+ month head start building and integrating these systems.

**Result:** Faster turnaround, lower overhead, delivery speeds traditional agencies cannot match. We pass these efficiency gains directly to you through our hourly model — you pay only for the hours used, at rates dramatically below market for this caliber of team.

### 3. Banking-Standard Quality. Senior Engineers Only.

Every project is led directly by our founders — ex-Meta and ex-IBM engineers with Georgia Tech backgrounds. Our team of 8 senior engineers brings 100+ years of combined experience.

**No junior developers. No outsourcing. No layers.**

Weipeng Zhuo (CEO, ex-Meta data scientist, Georgia Tech PhD) and Gabriel Perez (CTO, multiple startup exits, ex-IBM, Georgia Tech CS) are hands-on with every engagement.

**Our EU partner has 30+ years at Big Four firms** (KPMG, Deloitte, PwC, EY). His network expects institutional-quality work. We deliver.

**Result:** Senior-level expertise at every stage. Direct founder access. Big Four-level standards at startup speed.
