# Nexrizen EU Executive Overview

**Tagline:** We don't sell AI. We make it work for your business.

---

## The Challenge European Executives Face

Your teams are drowning in manual work. Customer inquiries go unanswered for hours. Data sits in disconnected systems. Scaling requires adding headcount proportionally to growth.

Traditional consultancies deliver slide decks. Implementation takes months. By the time the system is built, your requirements have changed.

---

## What We Build

### Custom Software Development
- Operational dashboards that surface real-time insights
- Database architecture for terabyte-scale data processing

- Integration systems connecting fragmented data sources

**Technology:** Python, TypeScript, React, PostgreSQL, Google Cloud Platform

### AI & Automation Systems
- AI chatbots handling customer service 24/7
- Document processing systems (contracts, invoices, intake forms)
- Meeting transcription and summarization
- Intelligent workflow automation

**Proven At:** Johns Hopkins (AI diagnostics), Fortune 100 financial institutions, legal firms handling immigration cases

### Fractional CTO Services

## Why Nexrizen Is Different

### Senior Engineers Only. Founder-Led Projects.
Every project is led directly by our founders — not delegated to junior developers or offshore teams. Weipeng Zhuo (CEO, ex-Meta data scientist, Georgia Tech PhD work) and Gabriel Perez (CTO, 15+ years engineering, ex-IBM, Georgia Tech Computer Science) are hands-on with every engagement.

**Result:** No miscommunication. No layers between you and the people doing the work.

### AI-Native Operations
We run our own business entirely on proprietary AI systems we built internally. Our sales pipeline, client proposals, project management — all automated with AI.

**Result:** Faster turnaround times, lower overhead, delivery speeds traditional agencies cannot match.

### Prototype-First Sales Process
After a single discovery conversation, we build a working prototype of the proposed solution — **before any contract is signed**. Not a slide deck. Not a proposal document. A functional application your team can interact with.

**Result:** You see exactly what you're getting. No visualization gap. No trust issues. Dramatically faster decision-making.

This is our standard process. The introducer benefits too — your recommendation delivers immediate, tangible value from day one.
