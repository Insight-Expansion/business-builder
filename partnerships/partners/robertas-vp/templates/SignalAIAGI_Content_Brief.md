### SECTION 1: The Problem We Solve

**Heading:** Why European Executives Choose Nexrizen

**Content:**

Your teams are drowning in manual work. Customer inquiries go unanswered for hours. Data sits in disconnected systems. Scaling your business means hiring proportionally — a model that doesn't work.

Traditional consultancies make it worse:

- They ask for €25,000-€50,000 advance payment before showing you anything
- They deliver slide decks, not working solutions
- Implementation takes 6 months
- By the time it's built, your requirements have changed

**The real cost isn't the consultancy fee — it's the months of lost productivity while you wait.**

Nexrizen does the opposite.

---

### SECTION 2: What Nexrizen Builds

**Heading:** What We Build — Outcomes, Not Features

**Three service boxes (use icons if available):**

**Box 1: Custom Software Development**

- Real-time operational dashboards (replacing manual reports from 5+ systems)
- Client-facing platforms and portals
- Database architecture for terabyte-scale data
- Integration systems connecting your fragmented tools

**Box 2: AI & Automation Systems**

- AI customer service handling 1,000+ conversations daily (replacing 8-person teams)
- Document processing (contracts, invoices, intake forms)
- Meeting transcription saving 1,300+ hours per year
- Workflow automation eliminating 3-5 hours of manual work daily

**Box 3: Fractional CTO / Technology Leadership**

- Technology strategy and roadmap
- Technical due diligence for acquisitions
- Engineering team leadership
- Architecture review and technical debt management

**Footer text:**

```
Technology: Python, TypeScript, React, PostgreSQL, Google Cloud Platform
AI/ML: GPT-4, Claude, LangChain, custom fine-tuned models
```

### SECTION 3: Why Nexrizen Is Different

**Heading:** Three Things No Other Consultancy Does

**Differentiator 1: Zero Risk — Free Prototype First**

Most consultancies ask for €25,000-€50,000 before showing you anything. Nexrizen builds you a working prototype — a real, functional application — after a single discovery call. Before any contract is signed. Before you pay anything.

Results:

- 90% response rate (vs industry 5-10%)
- 75-80% conversion to paying clients
- Zero financial risk

> "Most companies ask advance payment of 25,000 or 50,000 euros... when you say we do a small example just to test it and see, that's very good. That's very risk-free. Everybody likes it." — Robertas V.P., SignalAI AGI

**Differentiator 2: AI-Native Operations (6 Proprietary Systems)**

Nexrizen doesn't just build AI for clients — they run their entire business on AI they built themselves. Six proprietary systems. Three are public on GitHub — verifiable technology, not marketing claims.

This is part of an emerging industry shift: AI-native firms deliver finished outcomes at dramatically higher efficiency than traditional consultancies, and pass the savings to clients through faster delivery and lower costs. Nexrizen has an 18+ month head start.

Verify their claims: [github.com/Insight-Expansion](https://github.com/Insight-Expansion)

**Differentiator 3: Senior Engineers Only**

Every project is led directly by the founders — ex-Meta and ex-IBM engineers with Georgia Tech backgrounds. 8 senior engineers, 100+ years of combined experience.

No junior developers. No outsourcing. No layers between you and the people doing the work.

### SECTION 1: The Problem

**Heading:** You've Had This Idea for Months

You have an app idea — or a business process that desperately needs automation. But every option feels:

- **Too expensive** — You've gotten quotes for €50,000-€150,000
- **Too risky** — Pay tens of thousands before seeing anything?
- **Too slow** — 6-month timelines that never end
- **Too confusing** — You don't have a CTO and don't know where to start

You've been sitting on this idea. It's time to stop sitting.

---

### SECTION 2: How ThreeDays Works

**Heading:** Three Steps. Three Days. Zero Risk.

**Step 1: Tell Us Your Idea** (5 minutes)
Describe what you want in 2-3 sentences. That's it. No technical knowledge required. No 50-page specification document.

**Step 2: We Build It** (72 hours)
Our senior engineers — ex-Meta, ex-IBM, Georgia Tech PhDs — use our proprietary AI-native development toolkit to build a working prototype. Not a mockup. Not a wireframe. A real, functional application deployed to production.

**Step 3: You Decide** (zero pressure)
Interact with your prototype. Show it to your team. See if it solves your problem. If you love it, engage our team hourly at ~€110/hr to build the full version. If not, you've lost nothing.

**The prototype is free. Before any contract.**

---

### SECTION 3: What You Get

**Heading:** This Isn't a Mockup

A ThreeDays prototype is a **working application**:

- Deployed to production (real URL you can share)
- Functional UI you can click through
- Core features demonstrated with real data
- Mobile-responsive design
- Built on production-ready technology (React, Python, PostgreSQL, GCP)

**What it proves:**

- Whether the concept works
- What the user experience feels like
- How the technology fits your business
- Whether Nexrizen is the right team for you

---

### SECTION 4: Why It's Possible

**Heading:** How We Build This Fast

ThreeDays is powered by Nexrizen's proprietary AI-native development platform — 6 systems that automate the slow parts of software development:

1. **Proposal Builder** — Instantly synthesizes your requirements (20-30x time reduction)
2. **Lovable Prototype Generator** — One-click UI generation from your description
3. **ThreeDays Dev Toolkit** — Accelerated development framework ([public on GitHub](https://github.com/Insight-Expansion/threedays-dev-toolkit))
4. **Browser Automation Generator** — Custom automation per project ([public on GitHub](https://github.com/Insight-Expansion/browser-automation-generator))

Traditional agencies take weeks to produce what we build in days — because they're doing it manually. We're AI-native.

---

### SECTION 5: Who This Is For

**Heading:** Perfect For

- **Business owners** with an app idea they've been sitting on for months
- **Executives** who need to automate a manual workflow but don't know where to start
- **Startups** with funding who need an MVP but don't have a CTO
- **Companies** who got burned by offshore teams and want to see quality before committing

**Not for:**

- Enterprise with 6-month procurement cycles (we move too fast)
- Companies looking for the cheapest option (we're senior engineers, not offshore)
- Anyone who just wants a slide deck (we build real software)

---

### SECTION 6: From Prototype to Production

**Heading:** Love the Prototype? Here's What Comes Next.

ThreeDays is your entry point. After the prototype, you can engage Nexrizen as your **fractional AI and technology team**:

| What                    | Rate                                     | Timeline  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Full MVP build          | ~€110/hr ($120), typically 80-120 hours | 3-6 weeks |
| Ongoing development     | ~€110/hr, scale up or down as needed    | Flexible  |
| Fractional CTO advisory | ~€110/hr, strategic guidance on demand  | Ongoing   |

**No minimums. No long-term contracts. No advance payments.**

Most clients continue working with us because the relationship compounds in value over time. Your fractional AI team learns your business, your codebase, your goals — and gets faster and better at serving you.

## SHARED ELEMENTS & DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS

### Color Palette (match Nexrizen branding)

- **Primary accent:** `#502cff` (purple/blue) — CTAs, buttons, highlights
- **Navy:** `#1e293b` — headings
- **Slate:** `#475569` — body text
- **Blue:** `#2563eb` — links, secondary headings
- **Light background:** `#f8fafc` or `#eff6ff` — section backgrounds
- **White:** `#ffffff` — primary background

### Typography

- **Headings:** Inter Bold (or similar clean sans-serif)
- **Body:** Inter Regular
- **Minimum font size:** 16px for body text (web readability)

### Visual Recommendations

- No stock photos — use clean icons, abstract data visuals, or code screenshots
- Metric numbers should be large and prominent (visual anchors)
- Use alternating section backgrounds (white/light blue) for visual rhythm
- Include Nexrizen logo on both pages
- Include SignalAI AGI branding as "Featured by" or "Introduced through"

### Cross-Linking

- Nexrizen page should link to ThreeDays page and vice versa
- Both pages should have a "Contact Robertas" secondary CTA
- Both pages should link to nexrizen.com and threedays.ai

### Mobile Optimization

- All content should be mobile-responsive
- CTA buttons should be full-width on mobile
- Tables should scroll horizontally on small screens
- Test on iPhone and Android before publishing
