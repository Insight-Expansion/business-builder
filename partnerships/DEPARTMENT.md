## Current State Summary

**Partnership Model:** Authorized reseller / representative
- Partners introduce prospects from their networks
- Nexrizen handles technical sale, delivery, support
- Partners earn 15% commission on collected revenue
- Non-exclusive (initially)

**Active Partner:**
- **Robertas V.P. / BIG GROUP** (Luxembourg/Monaco)
  - 30+ years finance/banking/investment
  - Extensive EU/EEA executive network
  - Target verticals: Fintech, aviation, family offices, professional services, insurance/legal
  - Status: Proposal reviewed, agreement pending signature
  - Next step: Friday meeting with Wei and Gabriel

**Services Available Through Channel:**
1. **3-Day MVP** ($3K-$5K) - Working prototype in 72 hours
2. **Custom Software & AI** ($10K-$50K+) - Full development projects
3. **Fractional CTO** ($5K-$15K/month) - Strategic technical leadership

**Key Differentiator:**
> "After a single discovery meeting, we generate a working prototype of the proposed solution — a functional application, not a slide deck — before the prospect pays a cent."

This prototype-first approach eliminates visualization gap and reflects well on partner's recommendation.

**Commission Structure:**
- Rate: 15% of collected revenue
- Attribution period: 12 months from introduction
- Payment timing: Within 30 days of Nexrizen receiving payment
- Currency: USD or EUR (partner's election)

See [Current_State.md](docs/Current_State.md) for full details.

## What's Missing (Gaps)

**No historical data:**
- ⚠️ No deals closed yet (pilot phase)
- ⚠️ No conversion rate data
- ⚠️ No average deal size or sales cycle benchmarks via channel

**No collateral produced yet:**
- ⚠️ One-pager, case studies, capability sheets, deck all in planning phase
- Budget allocated: $1,200-$2,200 for design work
- Timeline: 4 weeks to produce all Priority 1 materials

**Operational systems needed:**
- ⚠️ Automated commission tracking
- ⚠️ Partner portal for lead status visibility
- ⚠️ Formal onboarding checklist

**Unknown:**
- Competitive commission rates in EU B2B software market
- Tax/legal implications of US-EU reseller payments
- Optimal partner communication cadence

---

## Next Steps (Immediate)

**This week (2026-02-10):**
1. Friday meeting with Robertas, Wei, Gabriel - finalize terms, identify 2-3 initial prospects
2. Sign reseller agreement
3. Begin Priority 1 collateral production (one-pager, case studies)

**Next 30 days:**
1. First introductions (1-2 warm leads to test process)
2. Complete all Priority 1 collateral
3. Set up commission tracking mechanism

**Next 90 days:**
1. Evaluate pilot results (conversion rate, revenue, lessons learned)
2. Decide: Scale with more partners? Exclusive territory for Robertas? Adjust approach?
3. Build operational systems (partner portal, automated tracking)

## Success Metrics (To Be Tracked)

**Once partnership is active:**

**Activity:**
- Introductions per quarter: Target 5-10 (pilot phase)
- Discovery calls conducted: Track
- Prototypes delivered: Track

**Conversion:**
- Introduction → Discovery rate: Aim for 50%+
- Discovery → Close rate: Track baseline

**Revenue:**
- Total revenue from partner channel: Track
- Average deal size: Track
- Commission paid: Track
- Customer lifetime value (repeat business): Track

**Operational:**
- Time from introduction to discovery: Target <1 week
- Time from discovery to prototype: Target 1-3 days
- Time from prototype to close: Target 1-2 weeks
- Commission payment accuracy: Target 100% (zero disputes)

**Current baseline:** All metrics at zero (pre-pilot phase)

## Learning Loop

2. Which verticals have highest close rate?
3. Which entry point works best? (3-Day MVP vs custom)
4. How does partner-sourced revenue compare to direct sales?
5. What collateral is most useful to partners?
6. What support do partners need most?

**Update this department overview monthly as data accumulates.**
