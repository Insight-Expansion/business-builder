## 1. HEADLINE

**Current:**
> Everyone's an AI expert. I just ship with it | Led tech at CITYROW through acquisition | 10k+ users at GaTech | Rock climber, boricua

**What's working:** The opening hook is great — punchy, memorable, differentiating. Keep it. "Rock climber, boricua" adds personality.

**What's missing:** No mention of Nexrizen, CTO role, the patent, or the multi-vertical breadth. "10k+ users" — the bio says 7,000+ students, so this might be rounding up; either way it's fine but should be consistent.

### Option A — Keep the hook, add Nexrizen + credentials
> Everyone's an AI expert. I just ship with it. | CTO & Co-Founder, Nexrizen | 2 Exits | Patent Holder | MS Georgia Tech | Rock climber, boricua

### Option B — Role-first with the hook
> CTO & Co-Founder, Nexrizen | Everyone's an AI expert. I just ship with it. | 50+ Production Apps | 2 Startup Exits | Patent Holder

### Option C — Builder identity (lean into the serial entrepreneur angle)
> Serial builder. 2 exits. 50+ apps shipped. | CTO & Co-Founder, Nexrizen | Patent Holder | MS Georgia Tech | Rock climber, boricua

### Option D — Minimal change (just add Nexrizen)
> Everyone's an AI expert. I just ship with it | CTO & Co-Founder, Nexrizen | Led CITYROW through acquisition | 7,000+ users at GaTech | Rock climber, boricua

**My recommendation:** Option A or D. The current hook is strong — just bolt on "CTO & Co-Founder, Nexrizen" so people know what you're building NOW. Option A packs the most credibility.

## 2. TOP SKILLS

**Current:**
- LangChain
- fCTO
- Python (Programming Language)

**Problem:** "LangChain" is a single tool (and may age badly), "fCTO" is abbreviation most people won't recognize, "Python" is table stakes. These should reflect your actual differentiators.

### Recommended:
- Fractional CTO & Technical Leadership
- AI-Native Software Development (Django, LLMs, Multi-Agent Systems)
- Full Startup Lifecycle: Build, Scale, Exit

### Alternative (more technical):
- AI Coding Adoption & Multi-Agent Orchestration
- Full-Stack Architecture (Django, Python, Cloud)
- Fractional CTO (EdTech, HealthTech, AgriTech, FitnessTech, Legal Tech)

## 3. SUMMARY / ABOUT

**Current is actually pretty strong.** The voice is distinctive and memorable. Main gaps:

- No mention of Nexrizen or what you're building now
- No mention of the patent
- No mention of the 6 proprietary AI systems you co-built
- No mention of trilingual (English/Spanish/Japanese)
- "50+ production apps" is there but could be enriched with vertical breadth
- Missing the "Your Next Great Developer Isn't Human" positioning from your website
- No CTA (what should people reach out about?)

### Recommended rewrite:

> Most software projects fail before code is written. The gap between business intent and technical execution is where budgets vanish. I lead through that gap.
>
> I'm the CTO & Co-Founder of Nexrizen, where we build AI systems in 3-12 weeks that other dev shops take 6 months to deliver. We've built 6 proprietary AI systems that power our entire business — sales, prototyping, development, automation, marketing, and operations. 3 of them are open source on GitHub.
>
> Your next great developer isn't human. I add them to your team.
>
> Before Nexrizen:
> - Led CITYROW's tech strategy through acquisition by WaterRower
> - Built and sold Caproni (podcast SaaS) — full lifecycle: ideation to exit
> - Scaled Peer Feedback to 7,000+ students at Georgia Tech over 10 years
> - Shipped 50+ production apps across 6 verticals (EdTech, HealthTech, AgriTech, FitnessTech, Ad-Tech, Legal Tech)
> - Architected CMS-compliant healthcare systems deployed across Puerto Rican hospitals
> - Patent holder: Distributed Computing Utilizing Homomorphic Encryption
>
> I'm the person companies call when their tech is broken and their previous agency ghosted them.
>
> I write about what actually works in production and how to avoid the over-engineered traps that sink startups. Follow for blunt takes on AI, software strategy, and building things that matter.
>
> Let's talk if you need:
> - A fractional CTO who's actually shipped and exited
> - AI-native development that delivers in weeks, not months
> - Someone to rescue a broken project or stalled MVP
>
> Trilingual: English / Spanish / Japanese

### What changed:
1. **Added Nexrizen + 6 proprietary systems** at the top (what you're building NOW)
2. **"Your next great developer isn't human"** line from gabezen.com — too good to leave off LinkedIn
3. **Structured the track record as bullets** — more scannable than a wall of text
4. **Added the patent** — currently buried in a separate section nobody reads
5. **Added vertical breadth** (6 verticals) — shows you're not a one-trick pony
6. **Added CTA section** — tells people what to reach out about
7. **Added trilingual** — real differentiator, currently only in Languages section which gets low visibility
8. **Kept the voice** — "blunt takes", "agency ghosted them", "building things that matter" — this IS the brand

## 4. HONORS & AWARDS — ADD CONTEXT

**Current:** Names only, no descriptions.

| Current | Update to |
|---------|-----------|
| GEM Fellowship Recipient | GEM Fellowship Recipient — National competitive fellowship for underrepresented STEM students |
| 3 Day Startup Competition - First Place | 3 Day Startup Competition — First Place (built a company in a weekend) |
| Reto 2.0 (Web 2.0 Challenge) Award Winner | Reto 2.0 (Web 2.0 Challenge) — Award Winner |

**Consider adding:**
- **Google Summer of Code Participant** (2010, Sunlight Foundation) — currently only in Experience, not Awards

---

## 5. EXPERIENCE UPDATES

### Nexrizen — NEEDS CONTENT (currently blank)

**Current:** Title only. No description at all. This is the biggest gap.

### Option A — Builder-voice (matches Gabe's brand)
> We build AI systems in 3-12 weeks that other dev shops take 6 months to deliver. How? We built 6 proprietary AI systems that run our own business — and we use the same approach for clients.
>
> As CTO, I lead:
> • Technical architecture across all client projects and internal systems
> • Engineering team of senior developers (2 PhDs, 3 engineers)
> • AI coding adoption — integrating tools weekly that didn't exist a month ago
> • Multi-agent orchestration systems (1,000+ decisions/day in production)
> • Demo delivery and partnership development
>
> 50+ production apps shipped. 58 projects across 10+ verticals. No PMs, no junior devs, no handoffs — senior engineers using AI workflows that give us 20-30x time advantages.
>
> 3 of our proprietary tools are public on GitHub: ThreeDays Dev Toolkit, Browser Automation Generator, Webinar Generator.

### Option B — Results-focused (leads with outcomes)
> Co-founded AI-native agency delivering custom software and AI systems for professional service firms. 50+ production apps shipped across 58 projects.
>
> Built 6 proprietary AI systems powering the company: Proposal Builder (20-30x faster proposals), Lovable Prototype Generator (working demos in minutes), ThreeDays Dev Toolkit (open source), Browser Automation Generator (open source), Webinar Generator (open source), Business Builder (AI operations OS).
>
> Leading a team of 8 (2 founders, 2 PhDs, 3 senior engineers) that delivers like a team of 20. 90% platform response rate. 75-80% demo-to-client conversion.

### Option C — Short and punchy (Gabe's natural voice)
> CTO at an AI-native agency that builds in weeks what others take months to deliver. 6 proprietary AI systems. 50+ production apps. 3 public GitHub repos. Team of 8 delivering like 20.
>
> I lead the tech. I ship the code. I add AI developers to your team.

**My recommendation:** Option A — it matches Gabe's voice and shows specifically what he does, not just what the company does.

---

### Peer Feedback — MINOR ENRICHMENT

**Current is solid.** Add one line:

> **Add:** "Platform active for 10 years — one of the longest-running student-built EdTech platforms at Georgia Tech."

This emphasizes longevity and sustainability, which is rare for student-founded projects.

---

### ContactAI — ADD THE RESULT

**Currently missing the 800% engagement stat.**

**Add bullet:**
> • Achieved 800% increase in client engagement rates

---

### Caproni — GOOD AS-IS

Current description is strong. The "ideation to exit" framing is exactly right. No changes needed.

---

### CITYROW (Fractional CTO) — ADD ACQUISITION DETAIL

**Add specificity about the acquirer:**

> • Spearheaded tech strategy that catalyzed CITYROW's acquisition by WaterRower (January 2024)

This makes the exit concrete instead of abstract.

---

### Cygnus Healthcare — MINOR ENRICHMENT

**Add compliance scope:**

> • Ensured 100% CMS compliance across multiple Puerto Rican hospitals — zero audit failures

---

### Google Summer of Code — GOOD AS-IS

This is already well-written. No changes needed.

---

## 6. PATENTS SECTION

**Current:** Just the title. Add a one-line description:

> **Distributed Computing Utilizing Homomorphic Encryption** — Method for performing computations on encrypted data without decryption, enabling secure distributed processing.

---

1. **Nexrizen description** — Currently BLANK. This is what you're actively selling. (5 min)
2. **Summary rewrite** — Add Nexrizen, patent, CTA, trilingual. (10 min)
3. **Headline** — Add "CTO & Co-Founder, Nexrizen". (2 min)
4. **Top Skills** — Replace LangChain/fCTO/Python with real differentiators. (2 min)
5. **Quick wins #1-7** — Low effort, high impact. (10 min)
6. **ContactAI 800% stat** — Easy add. (1 min)

**Total time estimate: ~30 minutes to update everything.**

---

## 9. OVERALL PROFILE ASSESSMENT

**What Gabe's profile does well:**
- Voice is distinctive and memorable ("I just ship with it", "agency ghosted them")
- Track record is genuinely impressive (2 exits, 50+ apps, patent)
- The CITYROW testimonial from the CEO is gold

**Biggest gaps:**
- Nexrizen has NO description — the thing you're actively building/selling is invisible
- Patent and trilingual skills are buried in sections with low visibility
- No mention of the 6 proprietary AI systems
- Top Skills are forgettable (LangChain, fCTO, Python)
- No CTA — people don't know what to reach out about
