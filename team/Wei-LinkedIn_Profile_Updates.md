# LinkedIn Profile Update Guide — Wei Zhuo

**Purpose:** Recommended changes to make on LinkedIn, with options where applicable.
**Based on:** `Wei_Zhuo_Bio.md`, `Nexrizen_Business_Overview.md`, `Nexrizen_Market_Positioning.md`, `Strategic_Vision.md`, case studies library (58 projects)

---

## 1. HEADLINE

**Current:**
> Ex-Meta | AI Visionary | 2x Startup Founder | Yogi - For fast relief, try slowing down.

**Problem:** Doesn't mention Nexrizen, your actual role, or what you DO. "AI Visionary" is vague and overused on LinkedIn. Missing Georgia Tech and published researcher credibility.

### Option A — Full Credentials (authority-first)
> CEO & Co-Founder, Nexrizen | Ex-Meta Data Scientist | PhD (ABD) Georgia Tech | Published Researcher | AILA Award Winner | Yogi — For fast relief, try slowing down.

### Option B — Outcome-first (what you do for people)
> I build AI systems that recover revenue for professional service firms | CEO, Nexrizen | Ex-Meta | PhD (ABD) Georgia Tech

### Option C — Hybrid (authority + hook)
> CEO & Co-Founder, Nexrizen | Ex-Meta | AI Systems That Actually Work for Law Firms & Pro Services | PhD (ABD) Georgia Tech | 2x Founder

### Option D — Keep the vibe, add substance
> Ex-Meta | CEO & Co-Founder, Nexrizen | AI Systems Architect | 2x Startup Founder | Published Researcher | Yogi — For fast relief, try slowing down.

**My recommendation:** Option A or D. You need "CEO & Co-Founder, Nexrizen" in there — right now someone landing on your profile doesn't immediately see what you're building.

## 2. TOP SKILLS

**Current:**
- Technical Leadership
- Product Development
- Data Analysis

**Problem:** Way too generic. These could be anyone. Should reflect your actual differentiators.

### Recommended:
- AI/ML Systems Architecture
- Generative AI & LLM Engineering (RAG, Agents, Fine-tuning)
- Data Science & Engineering (Meta-scale)

### Alternative (more client-facing):
- AI Strategy & Implementation for Professional Services

## 3. SUMMARY / ABOUT

**Current issues:**
- Doesn't mention Nexrizen by name or the 6 proprietary AI systems
- Missing your best proof points (90% response rate, 75-80% conversion, 58 projects)
- "For the past decade" undersells — it's 15+ years
- Track Record section is vague ("multi-million-dollar impact" — say $2M/month)
- Missing the meditation/discipline angle as a real differentiator
- "Law and accounting firms" — you don't really do accounting firms

### Recommended rewrite:

> I don't sell AI — I make it work for firms drowning in data, admin, and inefficiency.
>
> I'm the CEO & Co-Founder of Nexrizen, where we've built 6 proprietary AI systems that power every part of our business — from sales automation (20-30x faster proposals) to rapid prototyping (working demos before you pay us anything) to a full AI-native business operating system. We practice what we preach: 100% AI-native operations.
>
> Before Nexrizen, I spent 15+ years at the intersection of Big Tech (Meta), academia (Georgia Tech PhD research), healthcare (Genentech/Roche), and genomics — turning complex AI into systems that save time, recover revenue, and create clarity.
>
> **What we do differently:**
> - Build working prototypes BEFORE you pay — no other dev shop does this
> - 90% response rate on competitive platforms (vs industry 5-10%)
> - 75-80% demo-to-client conversion
> - Deliver in 3-12 weeks what takes others 6 months
> - Senior engineers only — no PMs, no junior devs, no handoffs
>
> **The numbers:**
> - Saved Meta ~$2M/month with ML-driven fraud detection
> - Built AI intake systems processing 1,000+ leads/day
> - 50+ production apps shipped across 58 projects in 10+ verticals
> - Scaled platforms to 7,000+ users
> - Published in JAAD (Johns Hopkins) and Lab on a Chip; upcoming book with Packt Publishing
>
> **Why I do this:**
>
> As a first-generation college student, child immigrant, and mental health advocate, I believe tech should empower, not overwhelm. I've completed 10-day silent meditation retreats annually for 10+ years — that practice brings the clarity and discipline behind everything I build.
>
> I partner with leaders who want AI to fuel growth and efficiency without losing the human side of their business.
>
> **Let's talk if you're exploring:**
> - AI consulting & custom systems for professional service firms
> - Fractional CTO engagements
> - Strategic partnerships on AI-native operations
> - Legal tech innovation (AILA award-winning work)
>

### What changed vs current:
1. **Opens with Nexrizen + 6 systems** (current version buries what you're building)
2. **Hard numbers instead of vague claims** ("$2M/month" not "multi-million-dollar impact")
3. **90% response rate / 75-80% conversion** — these are jaw-dropping and currently missing
4. **58 projects in 10+ verticals** — shows breadth
5. **Meditation as differentiator** — not just a tagline, positioned as the source of your discipline
6. **Dropped "accounting firms"** — not a real vertical for you
7. **Added "strategic partnerships"** to CTA — you're actively seeking these
8. **Added "AILA award-winning"** to CTA — buried in your current version

---

## 7. EXPERIENCE UPDATES

### Nexrizen — MAJOR REWRITE NEEDED

**Current problem:** Generic agency description. Doesn't mention the 6 proprietary systems, your metrics, or what makes you different. Reads like any dev shop.

### Option A — Systems-forward (shows the AI-native moat)

> We help professional service firms recover lost revenue and streamline operations — but what makes us different is HOW.
>
> We've built 6 proprietary AI systems that run our entire business:
> • Proposal Builder — 20-30x time reduction; auto-ingests meetings, emails, docs; generates working prototypes with one click
> • Lovable Prototype Generator — Working demos in minutes, not days
> • ThreeDays Dev Toolkit — Open source on GitHub; why we deliver in 3-12 weeks vs industry 6 months
> • Browser Automation Generator — Project-specific automation (public repo)
> • Webinar Generator — Marketing automation at scale (public repo)
> • Business Builder — AI-native business operating system (in development)
>
> Results: 90% platform response rate (vs 5-10% industry), 75-80% demo-to-client conversion, 50+ production apps across 58 projects. Team of 8 delivers like a team of 20.

### Option B — Outcome-forward (leads with what clients get)

> We build AI systems in 3-12 weeks that other dev shops take 6 months to deliver. How? We've built 6 proprietary AI systems that power our own operations — sales, prototyping, development, marketing, automation, and business intelligence.
>
> We build working prototypes before you pay us anything. That's why we convert 75-80% of people who see our demos into clients.
>
> 50+ production apps shipped. 58 projects across 10+ verticals. Team of 8 (2 founders, 2 PhDs, 3 senior engineers) delivering like a team of 20. No PMs, no junior devs, no handoffs.
>
> AILA Technology Innovation Award winner. 3 public GitHub repos. Ex-Meta, ex-IBM, Georgia Tech PhDs.

### Option C — Short and punchy

> AI-native agency building custom software and AI systems for professional service firms. 6 proprietary AI systems power our operations. Working demos before you pay. 3-12 week delivery. 50+ production apps. 58 projects across 10+ verticals. 90% platform response rate. Team of 8 with ex-Meta, ex-IBM, Georgia Tech PhD credentials.

**My recommendation:** Option A — it tells a story about WHY you're different, not just WHAT you do.

---

### Saenz-Garcia Law — ADD BULLETS

**Current:** Single paragraph. Break into bullets for scannability.

**Recommended:**

> Leading AI transformation for one of Texas's largest immigration law firms:
> • Architected intake system processing 1,000+ leads/day with 10x efficiency improvement
> • Identified $500K+ in potential revenue through AI/automation initiatives
> • Built real-time KPI dashboards integrating marketing, operations, and finance
> • Won AILA Technology Innovation Award for Omni-bot
> • Designed executive dashboard unifying all business intelligence

---

### Insight Expansion — MINOR ENRICHMENT

**Add to end of current text:**

> Grew revenue to $500K annually within 3 years. Projects span healthcare data (100TB at OMNY Health), genomics (PB-scale at Girihlet), fintech, and enterprise analytics.

---

### ContactAI — ADD THE KEY METRIC

**Currently missing the 800% stat. Add:**

> Achieved 800% increase in client engagement rates. Led team of 6 engineers and data scientists.

---

### Meta — ADD SPECIFICITY

**Current is decent but could be punchier. Recommended rewrite:**

> Translated executive goals into actionable AI solutions for advertising integrity:
> • Improved advertising revenue loss prediction model accuracy by 40%
> • Built XGBoost model for compromised case review quality prediction — estimated to save Meta ~$2M/month
> • Designed A/B testing frameworks for model validation
> • Routed high-risk cases to additional reviewer channels, directly protecting advertiser revenue

---

### OMNY Health — ADD THE DAILY VOLUME

**Add to end:** "Processed 1M+ patient records daily."

---

### Girihlet — ADD RESEARCHER COUNT

**Change "Deployed a Dash App on Heroku for interactive data visualization" to:**

> Deployed a Dash App used by 500+ researchers globally.

---

### Data Incubator — ADD RANKING

**Add:** "Ranked in top 5% of cohort."

---

### Georgia Tech Research — ADD BULLETS + MENTORSHIP

**Break paragraph into bullets:**

> • Built CNN models improving fluorescence image classification accuracy by 70%
> • Engineered automated microfluidic systems increasing throughput 1000x
> • Published in high-impact journals (Lab on a Chip, IF: 6.0)
> • Mentored 10 undergraduates; 3 won departmental research awards
