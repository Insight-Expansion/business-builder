## Summary

I don't sell AI -> I make it work, for firms drowning in data, admin, and inefficiency.

For the past decade, I've lived at the intersection of big tech (Meta), startups, and academia, turning advanced AI into systems that save time, recover revenue, and create clarity for professional service firms.

Because here's the truth:

Most law and accounting firms are sitting on a goldmine of untapped data, but they're still stuck chasing it manually.

That's where I step in.

### How I help:

- Recover 80% of lost leads with AI-powered intake funnels
- Cut admin load by 50% through workflow automation
- Unify insights across ops, finance, and marketing with real-time dashboards
- Surface answers in seconds with knowledge management bots

And unlike the "AI-in-a-box" hype, my work is grounded in:

- Ethical adoption
- Measurable ROI
- Sustainable systems you can actually scale

### Track Record

- Scaled AI initiatives at Meta, driving multi-million-dollar impact
- Built award-winning tools like Omni-bot, spotlighted at AILA
- Co-founded AI ventures adopted by enterprise firms
- Published peer-reviewed research & delivered talks on AI for legal ops

### Why I do this

As an immigrant founder and mental health advocate, I believe tech should empower, not overwhelm. I partner with leaders who want AI to fuel growth, efficiency, and resilience without losing the human side of leadership.

### Let's talk if you're exploring:

- AI consulting for professional service firms
- Partnerships on legal + accounting innovation
- Fractional CTO engagements
