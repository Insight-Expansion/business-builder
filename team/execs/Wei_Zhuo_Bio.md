## Professional Summary

Wei is a data scientist, AI strategist, and serial entrepreneur with 15+ years of experience spanning Big Tech (Meta), academia (Georgia Tech PhD research), healthcare (Genentech/Roche, OMNY Health), genomics (Girihlet), and startup leadership. He co-founded Nexrizen to help professional service firms — particularly law firms — recover lost revenue and streamline operations through AI and custom technology.

His career arc reflects a deliberate progression from deep technical research to applied business impact: from publishing peer-reviewed papers on microfluidics and machine learning at Georgia Tech, to saving Meta an estimated $2M/month with ML-driven fraud detection, to building an AI intake system processing 1,000+ leads/day for one of Texas's largest immigration law firms.

Wei's defining trait is his ability to translate complex AI capabilities into measurable business outcomes — not selling technology for its own sake, but making it work for firms drowning in data, admin, and inefficiency.

## Leadership & Personal Philosophy

### The Immigrant Founder Story

Wei is a first-generation college student and child immigrant who came to the US at age 10. He rose from low-income beginnings to leading AI initiatives at Meta and founding multiple ventures. This background shapes his mission to democratize AI and empower businesses responsibly.

> "As an immigrant founder and mental health advocate, I believe tech should empower, not overwhelm." — Wei (LinkedIn)

### Mental Health Advocacy

Wei is open about overcoming severe depression and anxiety during his PhD. This experience drives his commitment to fostering human connection and mental wellness alongside technological innovation. His tagline — "For fast relief, try slowing down" — reflects this philosophy.

> "If I wanted to be rich, I would have stuck with Meta. A huge part of it is growth and learning and just becoming a better person. Entrepreneurship is a great vehicle for that." — Wei (Gary meeting)

### Meditation & Spiritual Practice

Wei has completed 10-day silent Vipassana meditation retreats annually for 10+ years. He leans Buddhist in philosophy, studying Dharma and India history. He describes experiencing profound states in deep meditation that have shaped his worldview.

His upcoming ~1.5-month retreat (~March 28, 2026) serves dual purposes: personal practice and a strategic stress test proving Nexrizen's AI systems can operate without the CEO. If the business survives the retreat — automated outbound generates leads, Gabe converts them, Marta delivers work — then the systems are real, not marketing claims.

> "Spirituality is realizing that there is something greater out there that connects us all, brings meaning to the world, and we are in continual search of it." — Wei (Gary meeting)

### Values-Driven Client Selection

Wei is famously selective about who Nexrizen works with. He has turned down paying clients who didn't align with the company's values.

> "We've had rich clients get upset when we said no to working with them. Why? Because money isn't everything. We want to work with good people who are on a search for truth, who value their teams, who are building something meaningful." — Wei

> "I don't care what your religion is. What I care about is that you believe in truth, you're seeking to understand what the truth is. If I know you're on a journey to figure out what's true, then we can work together." — Wei (Gary meeting)

### Bootstrap Mindset

> "I'm not just trying to take your money. I want to be able to work with you. I think you are very interesting and a great person. Connecting with you, working with you — we have a bootstrap mindset." — Wei (Gary meeting)

### On AI-Native Operations & Vision

> "Execution is cheap these days with AI. What's expensive is domain expertise, your network, your ability to close deals. We handle execution — fast, efficiently, at a cost that makes sense because we've built systems that let us deliver like a team of 20 with a team of 8." — Wei (Israel meeting)

> "I am, at my heart, an entrepreneur. And at my heart, a creative engineer who is leveraging the most advanced AI technology that comes up literally a week or two ago to completely redesign how business is done. We're constantly on the cutting edge." — Wei (Zane meeting)

### Work Style

Wei's approach in sales conversations is distinctively authentic — casual, direct, and immediately solution-oriented. He often begins architecting solutions mid-conversation, offering to build proof-of-concept prototypes before any contract is signed. He runs 3-4 discovery calls per day, giving him constant exposure to new problem spaces.

> "There's a gap right now from how fast technology is moving versus how fast it's being applied in industry. I'm here to bridge that gap." — Wei (Gary meeting)

## Relationship with Co-Founder (Gabe)

Wei and Gabe met in grad school at Georgia Institute of Technology (both studying there during the 2012-2014 overlap). Their skills are deliberately complementary:

| | Wei | Gabe |
|--|-----|------|
| **Primary strength** | AI/ML + data science + business strategy | Full-stack engineering + startup lifecycle + execution |
| **Sales role** | End-to-end sales: Upwork, proposals, discovery calls, closing | LinkedIn lead gen, intro calls, demos, partnership development |
| **Operational focus** | Architecture, client relationships, thought leadership | Engineering delivery, team management, technical standards |

They formally partnered ~mid-2025 to create Nexrizen, combining Wei's Meta/PhD AI credibility with Gabe's serial-builder execution track record.

> "My CTO is absolutely brilliant. He's been an entrepreneur for over a decade. He's built startups — their tech systems got acquired — and he's also built his own SaaS and got acquired. Insanely brilliant guy." — Wei (Robertas kickoff meeting)

Both share a bootstrap mindset and values-driven approach to client selection. The partnership is built on mutual respect and complementary capabilities rather than overlapping roles.

## Strategic Context at Nexrizen

### Proprietary Systems Architect

Wei personally architected Nexrizen's 6 proprietary AI systems that power the company's operations:

1. **Proposal Builder** — Sales automation (20-30x time reduction, auto-ingests meetings/emails/documents, one-click prototype generation)
2. **Lovable Prototype Generator** — Rapid prototyping (working demos in minutes, integrated with Proposal Builder)
3. **ThreeDays Dev Toolkit** — Development framework (public GitHub repo, AI-assisted coding workflows)
4. **Browser Automation Generator** — Project-specific automation (public GitHub repo)
5. **Webinar Generator** — Marketing automation (public GitHub repo)
6. **Business Builder** — Operations OS (in development; ingests all business context for decision support)

### Sales Workload Breakdown

| Activity | Hours/Week | Delegatable? |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Upwork browsing, filtering, applying | 5-8 hrs | Partially (Ruth could filter) |
| Proposal building | 5-8 hrs | Becoming faster (<1hr each) but requires technical judgment |
| Discovery/sales calls | 5-8 hrs | Gabe can do some |
| Lead nurturing & follow-up | 3-5 hrs | Ruth could assist with scheduling |
| LinkedIn content & engagement | 2-3 hrs | Can continue during retreat (scheduled posts) |
| **Total** | **20-30 hrs/wk** | |

### Serial Builder Vision

Wei views Nexrizen as a training ground, not a final destination. The long-term progression:
1. Build the skills (current agency = classroom)
2. Achieve multiple exits (credibility + capital + pattern recognition)
3. Transition to leverage (courses, coaching, education products, passive income)

> "Every decision should be evaluated against: Does this build transferable skills and assets, or does it only serve this specific business?" — Strategic Vision

### Pricing Philosophy

Shifted all new work to hourly-only ($120/hr) in February 2026 after identifying fixed-price projects as the primary margin killer. This was described internally as "the most impactful financial decision made to date."

### Retreat as Strategic Proof Point

The upcoming ~1.5-month silent meditation retreat (~March 28 - May 2026) is both personal practice and the ultimate test of Nexrizen's "systems over heroics" principle. Success = automated outbound generates leads, Gabe converts them, engineers deliver work, business survives without the CEO.

> **Internal Only:** Wei's departure creates a single point of failure. Pipeline buffer is only ~4-6 weeks, roughly equal to the retreat duration. There is essentially zero margin for error.

> **Internal Only:** Personal runway for both founders is less than 2 months. This creates real pressure and limits the ability to take risks or invest in longer-term initiatives.

### Self-Awareness on Scale

Wei is candid about Nexrizen's current limitations and the gap between capability and client base:

> "We're creating such cool stuff every single day, and we're leveraging the coolest shit, but we're frying small fish right now, Zane. We're looking at Upwork for small clients... Immigration law firms also don't have too much money... How do we scale?" — Wei (Zane meeting)
