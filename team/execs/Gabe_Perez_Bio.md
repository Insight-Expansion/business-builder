## Professional Summary

Gabe is a full-stack engineer, serial entrepreneur, and fractional CTO with 15+ years of experience shipping production software. He has founded, built, and exited multiple startups — including leading CITYROW through acquisition as fractional CTO, building and selling Caproni (podcast SaaS), and scaling Peer Feedback to 7,000+ students at Georgia Tech over a decade.

His self-description cuts through the noise: "Most software projects fail before code is written. The gap between business intent and technical execution is where budgets vanish. I lead through that gap."

Gabe specializes in AI coding adoption, Django-based architectures, and the kind of hands-on technical leadership that startups need when their previous agency ghosted them. He holds a patent in distributed computing utilizing homomorphic encryption and was a Google Summer of Code participant early in his career.

At Nexrizen, Gabe serves as CTO, leading technical architecture, running daily LinkedIn content, handling demos and intro calls from his network, and developing partnerships. He is the company's public-facing technical voice and a consistent content creator on AI, software strategy, and startup building.

## Key Differentiators

### Serial Builder with Exits

Gabe has completed the full startup lifecycle multiple times — from ideation to exit. Caproni (podcast SaaS) was built, grown, and sold. CITYROW was guided through acquisition as fractional CTO. This isn't theoretical; it's demonstrated pattern recognition across verticals.

### Practitioner, Not Commentator

> "Most software projects fail before code is written. The gap between business intent and technical execution is where budgets vanish. I lead through that gap."

Gabe's LinkedIn presence and personal brand are built on shipping real production software, not abstract advice. His tagline — "Everyone's an AI expert. I just ship with it" — positions him as the builder in a sea of AI commentators.

### Professional Motto

> "Your Next Great Developer Isn't Human. I Add Them to Your Team."

This captures Gabe's approach to AI coding adoption: not replacing developers, but augmenting teams with AI-powered development workflows that multiply output.

### Trilingual

Native English and Spanish, professional Japanese — valuable for international partnerships and multilingual market expansion (relevant for EU/LATAM partnership development).

### Breadth of Verticals

Unlike specialists locked into one domain, Gabe has shipped production software across EdTech, HealthTech, AgriTech, FitnessTech, Podcast/Ad-Tech, and now Legal Tech. This cross-pollination of patterns across industries is a genuine competitive advantage for Nexrizen's diverse client base.

## Key Metrics (Sales-Ready)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Years shipping software | 15+ |
| Production apps shipped | 50+ |
| Startup exits | 2 (Caproni sold, CITYROW acquired) |
| Users scaled (Peer Feedback) | 7,000+ at Georgia Tech |
| Fractional CTO engagements | 4+ (CITYROW, Listen Network, ABACROP, Moxie) |
| Healthcare compliance | 100% across Puerto Rican hospitals |
| Entrepreneurship experience | 10-15 years |
| Open source | Google Summer of Code, Sunlight Foundation |

## Role at Nexrizen

| Responsibility | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| **Technical Leadership** | Architecture decisions, code review, engineering standards |
| **Sales (LinkedIn)** | Generates leads from personal profile; handles intro calls |
| **Content** | Daily LinkedIn posts on AI, software strategy, building |
| **Demos** | Client demos and technical presentations |
| **Partnerships** | Partnership development and relationship management |
| **Team** | Engineering team oversight and mentorship |

### Current Challenge

Gabe is currently overworked, managing both technical delivery and sales responsibilities. Wei is redistributing load by taking on more proposal building and sales calls. Pre-retreat, Gabe needs to become capable of closing deals independently when Wei is unavailable.

---

## Personal & Background

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Heritage** | Boricua (Puerto Rican) — born in Puerto Rico, raised bilingual English/Spanish |
| **Current Base** | United States (relocating to Spain Q2 2026 — initially short-term, possibly permanent) |
| **Interests** | Rock climbing, building startups, blunt communication about what works in production |
| **Languages** | English (native), Spanish (native), Japanese (professional working) — trilingual advantage for international expansion |
| **Values** | Shipping over theorizing, building things that matter, no-BS communication |

**Spain Relocation (Q2 2026):** Gabe is moving to Spain starting Q2 2026. Initially described as "at least for a couple months, if not forever" (Robertas kickoff meeting, Feb 2026). This creates EU timezone presence that complements the Robertas partnership and broader EU expansion strategy.

---

## Relationship with Co-Founder (Wei)

Gabe and Wei met in grad school at Georgia Institute of Technology (both studying there during the 2012-2014 overlap). Their skills are deliberately complementary:

| | Gabe | Wei |
|--|------|-----|
| **Primary strength** | Full-stack engineering + startup lifecycle + execution | AI/ML + data science + business strategy + sales |
| **Sales role** | LinkedIn lead gen, intro calls, demos, partnership development | End-to-end sales: Upwork, proposals, discovery calls, closing |
| **Operational focus** | Engineering delivery, team management, technical standards | Architecture, client relationships, thought leadership |
| **Personality** | Reserved, action-oriented, confirms and executes | Energetic, philosophical, immediately architects solutions |

They formally partnered ~mid-2025 to create Nexrizen. Wei brings Meta/PhD AI credibility and sales energy; Gabe brings serial-builder execution and technical depth.

**How Wei describes Gabe in client meetings:**
> "My CTO is absolutely brilliant. He's been an entrepreneur for over a decade. He's built startups — their tech systems got acquired — and he's also built his own SaaS and got acquired. Insanely brilliant guy." — Wei (Robertas kickoff meeting)

> "I have a co-founder who's been doing consultancy for 10 years. He's absolutely brilliant." — Wei (Nick intro)

Both share a bootstrap mindset and values-driven approach to client selection. The partnership is built on complementary capabilities, not overlapping roles.

## Strategic Context at Nexrizen

### Retreat Operations: De Facto Business Leader

During Wei's ~1.5-month silent meditation retreat (~March 28 - May 2026), Gabe becomes the primary business leader. His responsibilities:

| Responsibility | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| **Outbound monitoring** | Monitor automated LinkedIn DM + email campaigns |
| **Lead conversion** | Convert warm leads to hourly engagements ($120/hr) |
| **Client communications** | Handle all client interactions and project scoping |
| **Partner management** | Manage Robertas (EU), Rob, and any active partnerships |
| **Financial guardrails** | Monitor burn rate (~$12,600/mo minimum with reduced team) |
| **Emergency escalation** | Contact Wei only for truly critical decisions |

Gabe's startup exit track record (Caproni sold, CITYROW acquired under his technical leadership) is key evidence that he can lead a business independently during the retreat.

> **Internal Only:** Pre-retreat training needed in Weeks 3-4 (March 1-14): qualifying leads, scoping hourly engagements, closing deals without Wei. Gabe currently handles intro calls from his LinkedIn, but most follow-on sales calls (qualification, scoping, closing) are still handled by Wei.

> **Internal Only:** Currently overworked managing dual technical delivery + sales responsibilities. Wei is redistributing load by taking on more proposal building and sales calls. The retreat forces systemic resolution of this capacity bottleneck.

> **Internal Only:** Both founders have < 2 months personal runway. This creates real urgency around pre-loading the pipeline and ensuring the retreat period generates sufficient revenue.

### AI Coding Adoption Leadership

Gabe's professional motto — "Your Next Great Developer Isn't Human. I Add Them to Your Team" — reflects his approach to integrating AI coding agents into development workflows. At Nexrizen, he leads the weekly adoption of new AI tools and frameworks, continuously improving the team's development velocity.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

Gabe builds the multi-agent orchestration systems that power Nexrizen's client deliverables (e.g., the 1,000+ leads/day immigration intake system). These systems use confidence scoring (<80% certainty triggers human review) and machine learning feedback loops that improve over time.
