## Summary

Most software projects fail before code is written. The gap between business intent and technical execution is where budgets vanish. I lead through that gap. I took CITYROW through acquisition, scaled EdTech to 7,000 users at Georgia Tech, and shipped 50+ production apps. I am the person companies call when their tech is broken and their agency ghosted them. I write about what actually works in production and how to avoid the over-engineered traps that sink startups. Follow for blunt takes on AI, software strategy, and building things that matter.
