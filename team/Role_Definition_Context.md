# Role Definition Context — Nexrizen Leadership & Admin

**Purpose:** Synthesized context for defining formal roles/titles for the two co-founders and admin. Paste this into a separate Claude conversation to workshop role definitions.

**Ask Claude:** "Based on this context, help me define clear roles, responsibilities, and titles for Wei, Gabe, and Ruth that reflect what they actually do, what they should be doing, and what should be delegated or hired for."

## The Three People to Define Roles For

### Wei Zhuo — Current Title: CEO & Co-Founder

**Background:**
- PhD (ABD) Chemical Engineering w/ integrated AI/ML, Georgia Tech (#3 engineering)
- Ex-Meta data scientist (saved ~$2M/month with ML fraud detection)
- Founded Insight Expansion consultancy ($500K/year revenue)
- Co-founded ContactAI (800% engagement increase)
- Published: JAAD 2025 (Johns Hopkins), Lab on a Chip (65 citations); upcoming Packt book
- Data Incubator Fellow (top 2% of 3,000), Meyerhoff Scholar, Tau Beta Pi
- AILA Technology Innovation Award winner
- Fractional CTO at Saenz-Garcia Law (largest Dallas immigration firm)
- 10-day silent meditation retreats annually (10+ years), certified yoga instructor
- Languages: English (native), Mandarin (professional working)

**What Wei currently does (and approximate hours/week):**

| Activity | Hours/Week | Category |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Upwork browsing, filtering, applying | 5-8 hrs | Lead Generation |
| Proposal building (Proposal Builder tool) | 5-8 hrs | Sales |
| Discovery/sales calls (3-4/day) | 5-8 hrs | Sales |
| Lead nurturing & follow-up | 3-5 hrs | Sales |
| LinkedIn content & engagement | 2-3 hrs | Marketing/Brand |
| Client relationship management | 3-5 hrs | Account Management |
| Architecture & solution design | 3-5 hrs | Technical Strategy |
| Internal systems development (Proposal Builder, Business Builder) | 3-5 hrs | Product/R&D |
| Strategy & vision | 2-3 hrs | CEO |
| Partnership development | 1-2 hrs | Business Development |
| **Total** | **~32-52 hrs/wk** | |

**Key observation:** Wei spends 20-30 hours/week on sales alone. This is the single largest time commitment and the single point of failure for the business. The upcoming 1.5-month retreat forces this to be addressed.

**What Wei is best at (natural strengths):**
- AI/ML architecture and solution design (PhD-level technical depth)
- Translating complex AI into business outcomes (his defining trait per bio)
- Sales conversations — immediately architects solutions mid-conversation, offers POCs
- Thought leadership and credibility (Meta, publications, AILA)
- Building internal AI systems (6 proprietary tools)
- Philosophy-driven client selection and relationship building

**What Wei should probably NOT be doing:**
- Upwork browsing and filtering (5-8 hrs/week of low-leverage manual work)
- Routine lead nurturing and follow-up scheduling
- All proposal building (tool is getting faster but still requires his judgment)
- Every single sales call (Gabe needs to handle more independently)

### Gabe Perez — Current Title: CTO & Co-Founder

**Background:**
- MS Computer Science, Georgia Tech (#2 CS nationally)
- Patent holder: Distributed Computing Utilizing Homomorphic Encryption
- Ex-IBM engineer (zSeries systems); Google Summer of Code (Sunlight Foundation)
- Serial entrepreneur with exits:
  - Led CITYROW through WaterRower acquisition (Jan 2024) — "absolute game changer" per CEO
  - Built and sold Caproni (podcast SaaS) — full lifecycle ideation to exit
  - Founded Peer Feedback — 10-year EdTech platform, 7,000+ students at Georgia Tech
- 4 years healthcare compliance (Cygnus) — CMS-compliant systems across Puerto Rican hospitals
- GEM Fellowship; 3 Day Startup — First Place
- 50+ production apps shipped across 6 verticals (EdTech, HealthTech, AgriTech, FitnessTech, Ad-Tech, Legal Tech)
- Trilingual: English, Spanish (native), Japanese (professional working)
- Relocating to Spain Q2 2026 — EU timezone for partnership expansion

**What Gabe currently does (and approximate hours/week):**

| Activity | Hours/Week | Category |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Technical architecture & code review | 5-8 hrs | Engineering Leadership |
| Engineering team oversight & mentorship | 3-5 hrs | Engineering Management |
| LinkedIn lead gen (from his profile) | 3-5 hrs | Sales |
| Intro calls & demos | 3-5 hrs | Sales |
| Daily LinkedIn content creation | 3-5 hrs | Marketing/Brand |
| Partnership development (Robertas, etc.) | 2-3 hrs | Business Development |
| Client project delivery oversight | 3-5 hrs | Delivery Management |
| Multi-agent system builds | 3-5 hrs | Engineering (IC work) |
| **Total** | **~25-41 hrs/wk** | |

**Key observation:** Gabe is overworked, splitting between technical delivery AND sales. Wei is redistributing load by taking more proposals and sales calls. Pre-retreat, Gabe needs to become capable of closing deals independently.

**What Gabe is best at (natural strengths):**
- Full-stack engineering and rapid MVP delivery
- Full startup lifecycle (ideation → build → scale → exit) — proven multiple times
- Technical leadership and engineering team management
- AI coding adoption — integrating new tools weekly
- Multi-agent orchestration systems
- Django architecture, compliance systems (FERPA, CMS)
- Content creation (daily LinkedIn, practitioner voice)
- Trilingual communication for international expansion

**What Gabe should probably NOT be doing:**
- Routine client communications that don't require technical judgment
- All partnership admin and scheduling
- Low-value LinkedIn connection management
- Being the only person who can do demos

**Personality and work style contrast with Wei:**

| | Wei | Gabe |
|--|-----|------|
| Energy | Energetic, philosophical, immediately architects solutions | Reserved, action-oriented, confirms and executes |
| Sales style | Casual, direct, immediately solution-oriented, offers POCs | LinkedIn content, demos, partnership development |
| Brand voice | "Search for truth", meditation, immigrant founder story | "Everyone's an AI expert. I just ship with it." |
| Natural role | Visionary + rainmaker | Builder + operator |

---

### Ruth — Current Title: VA (Virtual Assistant)

**Background:**
- Virtual assistant, current hours ~30/week
- Cost: ~$1,200/month

**What Ruth currently does:**
- LinkedIn outreach execution (running Dripify campaigns)
- Upwork application assistance (filtering, initial responses)
- CRM/lead management (GoHighLevel, Notion)
- SOP execution (follows documented processes)
- Scheduling and follow-up coordination

**What Ruth could do with proper SOPs:**
- Full LinkedIn outreach system management (targeting, sequences, responses)
- Lead qualification (initial screening using documented criteria)
- CRM pipeline management and reporting
- Content scheduling and distribution
- Client onboarding coordination
- Administrative support for partnership communications

**Key observation:** Ruth is described as "smart" and "capable of running LinkedIn outreach system with proper SOPs." Her role could expand significantly if processes are documented. During the retreat, her hours may be reduced or paused if Gabe isn't actively selling.

---

## The Retreat Stress Test (March 28 — May 2026)

Wei's 1.5-month silent meditation retreat is the forcing function for role clarity. What happens when the CEO disappears:

**What MUST continue without Wei:**
- Automated LinkedIn DM + email outbound campaigns (systems run themselves)
- Warm lead conversion to hourly engagements (Gabe)
- Client communications and project scoping (Gabe)
- Engineering delivery (Marta + team, Gabe oversees)
- Partnership management — Robertas, Rob (Gabe)
- Financial monitoring (Gabe — burn rate, minimum revenue)
- Content posting (scheduled or Gabe takes over)

**What STOPS when Wei leaves:**
- Upwork lead generation (Wei's profile, manual process)
- Wei's discovery/sales calls (3-4/day)
- Wei's proposal building (requires technical judgment)
- Solution architecture for complex new projects
- Thought leadership and conference engagement

**Minimum viable business during retreat:**
- ~$12,600/month burn (with Susanna paused)
- ~105 billable hours/month needed from Marta (65% utilization)
- 1-2 active hourly projects sufficient to break even
- Pipeline must be pre-loaded before departure

## Current Responsibilities That Need a Clear Owner

| Responsibility | Currently Done By | Should Be Done By | Notes |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Upwork lead gen** | Wei (5-8 hrs/wk) | ? | Manual, low-leverage. Could Ruth filter? |
| **Proposal building** | Wei (5-8 hrs/wk) | Wei (but faster) | Proposal Builder reducing time to <1hr each |
| **Discovery calls** | Wei (5-8 hrs/wk) | Wei + Gabe | Gabe needs training on closing |
| **Lead nurturing** | Wei (3-5 hrs/wk) | Ruth | With proper SOPs and templates |
| **LinkedIn content** | Gabe (3-5 hrs/wk) | Gabe | His natural strength |
| **LinkedIn outreach** | Ruth + Wei/Gabe oversight | Ruth | Systems built, need to activate |
| **Demo delivery** | Gabe | Gabe + (someone else?) | Only Gabe can demo currently |
| **Technical architecture** | Wei + Gabe | Gabe primary, Wei strategic | Need clarity on split |
| **Engineering management** | Gabe | Gabe | Clear ownership |
| **Client relationships** | Wei primary | Wei + Gabe | Gabe handles his LinkedIn leads |
| **Partnership development** | Wei + Gabe | ? | Robertas (EU) aligns with Gabe's Spain move |
| **Financial management** | Wei | ? | No formal CFO/finance function |
| **Strategy & vision** | Wei | Wei + Gabe | Strategic Vision is co-owned |
| **Internal systems (R&D)** | Wei (Proposal Builder, Business Builder) | Wei | His IP, his vision |
| **CRM & pipeline management** | Ruth + manual | Ruth | Needs better tools/SOPs |
| **Onboarding new clients** | Ad hoc | ? | No formal process |
| **Paid ads** | Nobody yet | ? | $500-1K/month budget planned |

## Revenue Channels & Who Owns Them

| Channel | Current Revenue Share | Current Owner | Retreat-Proof? |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Upwork** | ~70% | Wei | No (pauses when Wei leaves) |
| **LinkedIn Inbound** | ~20% | Gabe (his profile) + Wei (his profile) | Partially (Gabe handles) |
| **Referrals/Network** | ~10% | Both | Passive |
| **LinkedIn DM + Email Outbound** | Activating | Systems (Ruth monitors) | Yes (automated) |
| **Partnerships (Robertas, Rob)** | TBD | Wei + Gabe | Partially (Gabe manages) |
| **Paid Ads** | Not started | Nobody | Yes (once set up) |

**Strategic goal:** Move from 70% Upwork to 60%+ non-Upwork channels post-retreat.

---

## The Four Pillars (From Strategic Vision)

The founders' long-term development priorities — roles should align to these:

| Pillar | Current State | Who Leads? | Gap |
|--------|--------------|------------|-----|
| **Technology Expertise** | Strong | Both (natural advantage) | Risk of over-investing here vs. other pillars |
| **Business Fundamentals** | Growing | Wei (sales) + gap (finance, systems) | Biggest gap — sales is founder-dependent, no systematized process |
| **Personal Brand** | Early | Gabe (LinkedIn content), Wei (thought leadership) | No strategic variation, LinkedIn-only |
| **Network & Partnerships** | Nascent | Both (ad hoc) | No systematic relationship management |

---

## Key Tensions to Resolve in Role Definition

1. **Wei is CEO + Head of Sales + Chief Architect + Head of R&D.** That's 4 roles. What should his actual focus be? What gets delegated?

2. **Gabe is CTO + Engineering Manager + Sales (LinkedIn) + Content Creator + Partnership Developer.** Also 4+ roles. His natural strength is building/shipping — is he being pulled too far into sales?

3. **Ruth is "VA" but could be "Sales Operations" or "Marketing Operations."** A clearer role with defined scope would increase her impact and make her more investable (from the company's perspective).

4. **Nobody owns finance.** Monthly burn, utilization tracking, cash flow — it's ad hoc. Who should this be?

5. **Nobody owns marketing as a function.** Content exists (Gabe's LinkedIn), but there's no strategic marketing leadership (paid ads, SEO, webinar strategy, email marketing).

6. **The "fractional CTO" identity conflict.** Both founders sell fractional CTO services to clients. Internally, Gabe is CTO. When both are "CTO," what does that mean for role clarity?

7. **Post-retreat role evolution.** If the retreat proves systems work without Wei, roles should permanently shift. Wei should NOT go back to 20-30 hrs/week sales.

8. **Spain relocation.** Gabe moving to Spain Q2 2026 creates EU timezone presence. This aligns with Robertas partnership. Should Gabe's role formally include EU business development?

## What the Business Needs (Functional Gaps)

Regardless of titles, these functions need clear ownership:

| Function | Need Level | Current State |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Sales Leadership** | Critical | Wei does everything; no process others can follow |
| **Sales Operations** | High | Ruth does some; needs SOPs, CRM, pipeline mgmt |
| **Engineering Leadership** | Covered | Gabe (clear owner) |
| **Technical Architecture** | Covered | Wei + Gabe (split unclear) |
| **Marketing** | Gap | Gabe does content; no strategy, no paid, no SEO |
| **Finance/Operations** | Gap | Nobody owns this formally |
| **Partnership/BD** | Growing | Both founders ad hoc; needs structure |
| **Client Success** | Gap | No formal onboarding or account management |
| **Product/R&D** | Wei | Internal systems (Proposal Builder, Business Builder) |
| **People/HR** | Minimal | 8-person team, mostly contractors |

---

## Constraints on Role Definition

- **Budget:** Can't hire new people right now (<2 months founder runway)
- **Team size:** 8 people total — roles will overlap by necessity
- **Retreat deadline:** ~6 weeks to have roles clear enough for Wei to leave
- **Revenue pressure:** Every hour spent on internal work is an hour not billing $120
- **Growth stage:** Pre-product-market-fit on non-Upwork channels; still experimenting

## Questions for Claude to Help Answer

1. What should Wei's, Gabe's, and Ruth's titles and primary responsibilities be?
2. What are the top 3-5 responsibilities each person should OWN (not share)?
3. What's currently being done by Wei/Gabe that should be automated, delegated to Ruth, or dropped entirely?
4. How should roles evolve post-retreat if the systems prove they work?
5. When the company can afford it, what's the first role to hire for?
6. How do you handle the "both founders are CTOs to clients" identity?
7. Should Gabe's role formally include EU business development given the Spain move?
