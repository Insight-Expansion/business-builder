hello hey hey how's it going good nick yes good to meet you man nice to meet you too we uh we met on linkedin right making sure okay i'm gonna i'm gonna ask the question before i mess it up how do i pronounce your name properly oh you can just call me way wait okay cool uh nick all right, must be easy having an easy name to pronounce huh um cool yeah i wanted to i want to link up because.
00:00:35 Speaker 1
um it seems that we have very similar stuff like technology and you're an executive, um we do a lot of technology work too.
00:00:42 Speaker 2
I love the way you've packaged up the AI 3K, 3As thing, that's kind of smart.
00:00:47 Speaker 1
Thank you! Oh, Ibsen's been doing really well.
00:00:50 Speaker 2
Yeah, how's it. 
00:00:51 Speaker 1
It's been doing really, really well. I mean, we've been in the software and AI consultancy space for like 5 plus years, right? I was working on Meta even while I was starting to work on my consultancy. And then I partnered up with my co-founder, and he's been doing consultancy stuff for like 10 years. And we've been doing that for a while now, and then we got a little anxious this year because of the whole vibe coding community. All the vibe coding tools, and all the vibe coders, and everyone's an AI guru now on YouTube and social media.
00:01:26 Speaker 2
It's crazy.
00:01:27 Speaker 1
And then we're like, hey, are they taking...
00:01:29 Speaker 2
AI, and everyone knows they can do it, or thinks they can do it themselves. Yeah.
00:01:33 Speaker 1
yeah we're like we need to differentiate between these people but then we're like wait a minute why don't we just like go with the flow and actually market that we're using ai to speed everything up because that's exactly what we do right and uh do a fixed price uh fast, uh cheap and good delivery right and because the the basic the pain point like you said like uh people that does y coding is they get 70 of the way done right and then they can't finish it and the

re's so much like security regulatory like just just holes that just prevents them from.
00:02:09 Speaker 1
having a production ready product that's scalable and can have users right so, that's what we market now is saying hey we we can build it really fast really well, we use ai we have our own internal proprietary ai configuration system um that speed up development and we pass down the cost and the time savings to you, And that's been doing really, really well, actually. We literally just started the service maybe early last month, and we've already finished.
00:02:43 Speaker 1
10 projects with 10 clients just for the service. We have retainers for past clients for bigger projects, but the new clients, we finished about 10, 10 to a dozen. Every single project we do, we improve our system, our AI coding workflow. So, it's taking a shorter and shorter amount of time to build similar projects. We have another pipeline. We have a wait list of about a dozen, like 10 to 12, that is in the wait list for projects.
00:03:16 Speaker 1
to get work done. We've onboarded two new software engineers just so we can work on the capacity that we have. And ... Okay. Yeah, it's doing really, really well. And it's a lot of fun, right? Because we, it's basically a canvas to be creative and to be innovative. There's so much AI stuff going on. Not only are you incorporating new tools and new AI coding frameworks into our coding system, but we're also uprooting and redefining what it means to be a business in the age of AI, right? Like, for example, when we apply for projects on like freelance websites, we still do that as like,
00:03:58 Speaker 1
even though it's, even though it's getting pretty swamped. When we apply for projects on Upwork website, we have an automated workflow of generating the front end. If a project has a front end component, and it has a sufficient description in their projects description, we generate a front end for them immediately and send it over. As part of o

ur application, right, you know, and then they look at it. They're like, holy shit.
00:04:28 Speaker 1
You've already built like for them. It seems like you've already finished this project, right, right? They're like, how do you have time to do this? Right and, Literally, no one is doing that right now.
00:04:41 Speaker 2
Right, I guess I guess it's a numbers thing. Right and if it doesn't if that doesn't.
00:04:50 Speaker 1
Automate it's all automated, right and we have a demos subdomain in our on our, website that we just generate these landing pages for, right as part of our sales process and, Literally, I would say like 90 of people who just viewed our application, Basically have to message us, and out of those maybe like you know uh three quarter eighty percent of them end up being our clients even with like upwork applications there'll be like hundreds of applicants for each project.
00:05:22 Speaker 1
right we'll just stand out so much so um nick you're welcome to use this tool by the way like this this figure it's like there's enough pie for all of us right and i'm and i want to provide value for everyone to talk to um and i'm pretty open with this stuff but what i'm trying to say is there's so much space for innovation not just on the technical aspect of it but for the sales and marketing aspect of it you know like ai is uprooting fundamentally how we think about business and we are really just like redesigning everything um so it's been really fun yeah yeah it is really.
00:05:56 Speaker 2
interesting to see and it's and you've got these expectations that are changing somewhat in sync with what's possible and some what was not right i think that's fascinating and very different. understand what's possible and what can be done and so whereas a year ago when things in general weren't changing as quickly everyone was kind of coming in with the same level yeah.
00:06:30 Speaker 2
of the 10 or 12 projects you've done are they would you say the majority of thos

e you've applied for or you are you doing kind of more outboundy stuff and we've literally haven't.
00:06:43 Speaker 1
done any marketing just because we're so like uh so full with uh with the actual work right now, um uh half of them i would say we got from conferences uh so conference is still the best way to meet people who have large projects and large companies right we go to like entrepreneurship conferences we're pretty big in the immigration law firm field niche, We're actually talking on a couple panels in December for a conference there, And we know a lot of big names there. So so we get referrals from them.
00:07:17 Speaker 1
and the half of it we get from up work just our our current sales pipeline is just like really really, Powerful, But we we are hiring marketing people. We're hiring additional virtual assistants and we're hiring new engineers and and. so then like once we train them and, We get a marketing person then we have the capacity to on for additional clients, right? Then we can start doing actual marketing.
00:07:48 Speaker 1
And but we right now we're building the system the SOPs in anticipation for increased demand.
00:07:55 Speaker 2
And do you think the is the longer-term vision? Lots and lots of the starter 3k projects or is it actually that 10% of those will turn into bigger consulting clients more like the older model. 
00:08:09 Speaker 1
Yeah, I mean as you know, right? Um, a lot of it is upselling like the 3k is the MVP, Of the core aspect of what one's needs, right? it will it will mitigate a majority of the pain points of the what the client needs, but, You know a lot that we still upsell them For additional packages, right? So right now we're doing a price anchoring method of like 3k 6k and like a 10k.
00:08:39 Speaker 1
Most of the clients choose the 6k right and then and then we upsell them even once that project is finished We suggest the new features and new work, right? Because we're pretty creative people too and we have a 

lot of entrepreneurship business background. So we know what can improve their value proposition, On top of that, we have a managed service model. They pay us between $500 to $1,000 a month, and basically, it's like the management subscription.
00:09:11 Speaker 1
We're continuously on call for whatever is broken. We give them priority access to build additional features, so they're not in the back of the wait list anymore, and we do the hosting calls for them. So then, not only is it one-off projects, but we have up-selling retainers for clients that have a lot of projects, but also it becomes more of a subscription model, where we generally recurring revenue. Yeah, so that's. 
00:09:41 Speaker 2
Really smart, man.
00:09:42 Speaker 1
Yes, sir. But it's been a lot of fun. Yeah, yeah.
00:09:47 Speaker 2
That's really cool.
00:09:48 Speaker 1
Yeah. How are you doing? I'm just Dorsa. I just talk all about myself.
00:09:52 Speaker 2
No, no, no. It's cool. Yeah. i feel really old-fashioned in comparison no no joking i mean i think it's interesting our models are similar obviously so we're we're kind of strategic technology development experts who, help growth stage and larger companies kind of transform through technology so we've got kind of a remit of skills from kind of product and ux through engineering um and kind of come from the back of business builders like you were talking about i think rather than just kind of um so.
00:10:31 Speaker 2
um and kind of recognize that we we can build a very long-term relationship with clients by by delivering projects that deliver our work so it's all about building value things as opposed to just building work and across a mixture of like web applications and things and then kind of more, Yeah, so five years ago, we kind of moved into the IoT space, and that's kind of an area we've been playing with a lot, so kind of the hardware, software stuff, and suddenly it becomes a lot more interesting when you're not just constrained with

in a phone or within a browser, all of these things that you can do wrong in the real world.
00:11:10 Speaker 1
Hardware stuff, hardware, software stuff, interesting. Like, you build hardware now. 
00:11:14 Speaker 2
No, no, we've got some people who have fairly strong hardware backgrounds, but we work with either in-house hardware teams or with partners. I kind of help define at the firmware and API level and how that works with either Bluetooth interfaces or WebSocket, mobile connections or whatever, but then design the end-to-end user experience around that, which is not then just like, hey, what's the conversion flow? It's like, where are they using this, and how does it fit in? So we've done integrations with admissions in hospitals and printers. We've done adult collars. We've done health work.
00:11:53 Speaker 2
kind of a variety of different things but you've kind of got these very different kind of use cases and user personas interesting um so that's really fun um and then of course yeah more recently, um so over the last couple of years kind of working on some different ai related projects um and obviously kind of bringing that the, updated stuff into our workflows so we're using some of the newer tools um to build some things faster but some things it isn't much faster yeah oh yeah it depends depends what you're doing so that's kind of our background great.
00:12:27 Speaker 1
great yeah i love that it sounds like you've been doing this really well for a really long time and have your operations down um and it sounds like you have a good uh trust with your clients and a pretty good um uh uh like long-term relationship with the clients that you build.
00:12:45 Speaker 2
yeah i think i think figuring out how to make them successful was kind of very much the key that we started with, I think you've mentioned that earlier right which is the thinking from an entrepreneurial side in terms of what feature the functionality you need to to add value and doing that 

throughout then makes them go hey they're not just they're not just trying to build me for building shit they're actually trying to make me more successful I pay some more money from this what's the next feature they suggest we should do that too.
00:13:11 Speaker 1
yeah yeah I think that's fine agreed agreed Nick so how do you think we can.
00:13:16 Speaker 2
help support each other um I think I think it's a couple of things potentially right um obviously you've you've got your, actually we're not very good at small fast projects that's not our thing right we think about small teams of a few people for kind of in months rather than anything else right that's kind of the way we construct things and so we've done some smaller bits and pieces for existing clients but for sure we don't have to.
00:13:48 Speaker 2
new client projects. so that that's kind of fascinating and a clear kind of difference um so i think that that's interesting from a kind of a difference in kind of skill set um and i think you know maybe on the the kind of the larger more meaty things where you guys are kind of more focused on and kind of getting things going and working smart and very efficiently than maybe some cases not quite the.
00:14:24 Speaker 1
right market yeah i love that i um yes that is uh we are in different customer market segments at least for this service we are targeting greenfield projects and a lot of our customers so far, are firms that don't have existing technology in-house technology team or a lot of technology tools that they develop right um so uh so so that's that's kind of our our market segment.
00:15:00 Speaker 1
uh greenfield projects for smbs who don't have a lot of technology we also build greenfield projects for larger companies that maybe they want to do internal development of brand new ideas right that doesn't have a lot of um uh archaic uh systems that they need to renovate and it could just be completely clean and new right um so i i think so nick we can c

omplement each other in that way where if i get a client where there's a lot of brownfield system and we.
00:15:36 Speaker 1
have to integrate with something that they already have it's kind of messy it's a long-term project right i can i can i just send them over to your way, If you find clients with greenfield projects that needs like quick and speed, or if it's just a greenfield project that doesn't require the speed, maybe there's a huge scope, but we can build an MVP for you in a week, and then you can kind of build on top of that for additional things.
00:16:10 Speaker 1
We are happy to be an extent of your development team for just the kind of rapid prototyping services.
00:16:19 Speaker 2
That's really interesting. I'd love to see some kind of examples of what you've been doing and kind of a bit more into the details of that stuff. We should save some time if you're open to it.
00:16:28 Speaker 1
Yes, yes, I will. We are currently finalizing our portfolio. and getting testimonials and case studies from the project we've rebuilt. So I'll get that to you. And then once I get that to you, we can hop on a call with my CTO and we can kind of map out maybe how this partnership might look like. And again, we can work so you can refer them directly to us.
00:17:07 Speaker 1
if it's like a pretty open or pretty constraint and bounded project, greenfield project, MVP project, or if it's a larger project and you want us to build something, build an MVP for it, or build a foundation for it real quick, we can just work under you and white label our service. So we can talk about that, but yeah. So it sounds like next steps.
00:17:38 Speaker 2
for your kind of references, case study kind of stuff together, shoot that over when you're. scheduled to have a longer catch-up, you can dive into a bit more detail on the web spectre side and some of the projects and then really have a bit more of a live demo of kind of how you think about putting a box around these things and kind

 of in three days. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, we are happy to.
00:18:11 Speaker 1
do that. Do you want to set a time to meet, set our follow-up meeting now, or should we just wait until? So I'm out from 14th to the 21st, but I'm open outside of that. Would something on the 13th.
00:18:35 Speaker 2
work or should we go after that. 
00:18:37 Speaker 1
Third thing should work. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Same time. 
00:18:43 Speaker 2
Yeah, you're in Eastern, right? So this is 10 a.m.
00:18:48 Speaker 1
Yes, sir.
00:18:49 Speaker 2
Yeah, 10 a.m. Eastern on the 13th.
00:18:52 Speaker 1
Okay, great, great. I will send you a little summary of what we talked about and action items and then CC my co-founder on it. And then we'll send you the portfolio and case studies before that. And then we can have our chat on Thursday.
00:19:10 Speaker 2
Perfect. Awesome. Really good to meet you, man. Thanks for your time.
00:19:13 Speaker 1
Yes, sir. Nice to meet you, too. Talk to you soon.
00:19:16 Speaker 2
All right. Take care. Have a great weekend.
00:19:17 Speaker 1
You, too. Bye-bye.
