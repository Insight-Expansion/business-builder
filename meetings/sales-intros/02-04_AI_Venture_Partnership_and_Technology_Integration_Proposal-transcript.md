  
00:00:01 Speaker 1  
Hey Zane, I'm glad we're able to speak. How are you? I'm good. I'm good. No problem. Um, yeah, I'm in Hawaii right now, actually. So it's like six hour difference. Yeah. Are you on holiday? I wouldn't say holiday. It's like a client on site work, but half fun, half work. Yeah, it's like 50% holiday. That's a good thing. That's a good thing. So let me try and tell you what we're trying to do so you can get an idea. So.  
00:00:36 Speaker 2  
we're talking to, we, um, we have some good relationships with a number of, um, VC, right? So as a 16, um, one or two people at Sequoia, um, a couple people at Google Ventures, um, um, and then a number of different funds, right? That are into, um, into LE Finance. I wanted to ask you a question. What we're trying to do is we're trying to put together a team of highly,  
00:01:06 Speaker 2  
just a team of some PhDs and some highly qualified people to essentially build a team, to initially work on the data annotation, but more than that, to build up many AI businesses. Because as you know yourself, what investors are looking at right now, because this is a fast-moving environment, they want to make sure they're investing in a team. It's a team they're investing in because what the team can do, the team can pivot, right?  
00:01:37 Speaker 2  
So if there's a mix of skills. So I've got somebody who's a PhD who's also at a MIT research lab. I've got three... Whoa, the guys have it now. I've got somebody who's... He's at CVS. He's basically doing all of their machine learning for CVS. He's right at the top in terms of data annotation.  
00:02:08 Speaker 2  
and specialized annotation, especially for CVS. Cool. I've got a lady who's a doctor. She's a PhD, she's a double PhD. She's got a PhD in medicine and I think a PhD in whatever. So what we're trying to do essentially is to say, look, potentially, right, can we have, oh, and I've got, what is it? Our advisor is a guy called Henry Chen. He's a co-founder of a company called Sapien. I don't know if you know Sapien.  
00:02:36 Speaker 1  
I've heard of them.  
00:02:38 Speaker 2  
Yeah, so he's a co-founder of Sapien. He's an advisor. He's going to help us with the go-to market because he did a lot of GTM for Sapien. So he knows all of the people who are saying this and everybody from the Alibabas to... Tencent to the Chinese side to right across the European side he's confident that he can unlock doors in terms of what we're trying to do so essentially this is an open-ended conversation to say well that how can we what are you what.  
00:03:11 Speaker 2  
are your big ideas because obviously well this is what we're trying to do is to leverage the team's core skills and put something together essentially the the data annotation is that's entree yeah and I was speaking to Jared at CVS and we're saying listen he thinks that data annotation can be an important mode especially for like.  
00:03:43 Speaker 2  
his field is very specialized and he has specialized skills in um in in that space that cvs operates operates in so just trying to and what you're thinking what your free flow is because you seem to be very dynamic from what you sent me yeah yeah well thanks for that.  
00:04:01 Speaker 1  
introduction zane sounds like you're assembling an avenger team for like ai uh businesses right uh i love that um uh so you're trying to assemble a team it's more uh important that you have a core team of very capable and comprehend with comprehensive skill sets right.  
00:04:22 Speaker 2  
and that's dynamic enough yeah yeah and yeah and it doesn't matter because as long as each, Every team member brings whatever skill sets that they have and whatever else is required. Remember, it's not going to be perfect. We can always supplement, right, as long as there are core tips and core skills. So what happened is that I know a couple of people, as you know yourself, I'm sure you know this space. This space is very small. I know a lot of people in the venture, like along with VC.  
00:04:55 Speaker 2  
So what I did, we spoke to them, I spoke to them last year. And I wanted to find out the mindset and the general mindset that I got is that there's, going to be a lot of deployment of capital, like anything else, it's going to be done at pace. And as it's VC, a lot of it's going to, as you know, a lot of it fails, right? A lot is going to burn out. Yeah. That's it. The most important thing, as you know yourself, is that the good part about AI with the right team is you can get what is essentially called an enhanced seed round, yeah?  
00:05:35 Speaker 2  
Seed rounds are not $3 to $50 million, $3.5 to $50 million, you know, that standard, right.   
00:05:40 Speaker 3  
Right, right.  
00:05:40 Speaker 2  
And you're scaling at a faster pace throughout, yeah? Right, right. You know, yeah, so seriously, it's just scaling at a fast, you know, at a rapid pace. So that's a mindset and saying, look, what we're more concerned with is can you come to us with a team that's highly competent, right? And we can put money at the right thing. So I introduced data annotation as, obviously, the data is the new oil. So that's our entry point.  
00:06:10 Speaker 2  
But we're not, it doesn't preclude us from doing everything else. Yeah. Because I did, by chance, a video with you yesterday from... One of our concepts in the AZ-16 Center, which was a video sent to you yesterday, where they're talking about specialization. Do you ever watch that? Where he's talking about the companies that he's investing in.   
00:06:39 Speaker 1  
Did you see it? No, no, no. I didn't get a chance to see that. I'm sorry.  
00:06:43 Speaker 2  
Oh, okay. No, no. I just wanted to see you.  
00:06:46 Speaker 1  
Specializing AI opens new investment.  
00:06:48 Speaker 2  
Just investing insight.  
00:06:49 Speaker 1  
Right, right, right. Interesting. So, why don't I give you a little rundown of what I'm good at and what I'm not good at in my history. Okay, sure. So, I went through a PhD in chemical engineering, right? And I did a lot of machine learning research and computer vision research at Georgia Tech, which you might know as like number three engineering school in the country. I built a lot of hardware stuff too, so it's integration of software and hardware for live machine learning systems.  
00:07:25 Speaker 1  
And then left and went into data engineering, so worked on specializing scalable data processing, so distributed data processing for genomic data, like terabytes of data processed per day. And then moved over to Genentech, which is a huge biotech firm, and then ended up at Meta working on machine learning algorithms and data analytics. Then about two and a half, three years ago, I decided I wanted to learn more about business.  
00:07:58 Speaker 1  
I wanted a better route for growth, and I feel like just being an engineer is very constraining. Just being a technician is very constraining, so I moved there. And I'll tell you all this stuff, why these are relevant, but my career trajectory has been specialization. And then broadening it to additional skills, and then realizing that things are moving really, really fast, and I want to have a lot more broader business skills also, and knowing what opportunities exist.  
00:08:32 Speaker 1  
So we went into business, and now what we do, so I own a firm, I'm a CEO, I have a CTO, I have a handful of engineers. We basically, we are half R\&D and half service. So we are a consultancy that builds custom software, but we're also a consultancy that builds internal systems. So as you said, AI is moving insanely fast, so we're constantly on the lookout for new tools, and we're integrating new tools.  
00:09:03 Speaker 1  
To basically completely uproot and rebuild the whole business operations. I can show you some examples later. The reason why I'm telling you all these stuff is I have technical background, I have specialized in my past, now I'm more gearing towards creativity route and knowing what opportunities are there. I mean I have these discovery calls like three or four times a day right with different clients so.  
00:09:34 Speaker 1  
I know what problem space are there I'm constantly coming up with solutions with some of the most creative and newest tools out there and we're building a lot of really cool tools internally that's like literally not possible like half a year ago you know so we're constantly on the on the cutting edge. So there's specialization, there's a lot of deep deep knowledge on machine learning algorithms, predictive modeling, generative AI but also fluidity in business and entrepreneurship and how to be agile in adopting the most.  
00:10:09 Speaker 1  
um advanced technology into practical applications right saying i think there's a gap right now from um how fast technology is moving versus how fast it's being uh applied, in industry you know this right that's why there's so many like low-hanging fruits and so many ventures and so many startups springing up because the technology is way in advance, um than the applications right now and that's basically what i'm doing now is i'm bridging a gap in creative ways um so what i can offer is i have a lot of internal tools that i think.  
00:10:47 Speaker 1  
are going to be really really cool in the next couple years that we're building um but most importantly is this visionary mindset and um this uh ability to like innovate and read all the what keep up to date with all the innovations and then how to apply them, Right. And I have a lot of technical background. I do some of the coding myself. Right. So I'm pretty well versed there. I'm not good at I wouldn't be someone that you would hire for just, you know, deep technical specialized work and just coding it all day and not needing to question and be curious about the directions that we're going.  
00:11:30 Speaker 1  
You know what I'm saying? If you're still with me, let me show you something that we've been building that we think are really exciting. Sure. Sure. That have you heard of called claw code? I am. You know, you know what? Right.  
00:11:47 Speaker 2  
I am. I'm actually, you know, you can go ahead. Basically, I was in touch with the guy. I was in touch with the guy who built it. Oh, nice. Nice. Nice. Yeah, but it's not looking to raise capital.  
00:12:06 Speaker 1  
Right, right, right. So Cloud Code basically completely, it's a new paradigm shift of baseline agentic infrastructure and tools that agent can use for you to be able to architect agents. So they have these commands, skills, and agents, and they're also revolutionizing MCPs for, agent-to-agent communication. So Anthropic is advancing the agent community, AI community, miles ahead of everybody else.  
00:12:37 Speaker 1  
Their Cloud Code is the best in the market for agent tech coding infrastructure. And the important part is they allow you to build on top of their agents, right? So you can specialize your agents very easily and create your own workflows. so something i do like i told you i do every day is like i do a handful of uh client discovery calls right and i propose solution architectures so i used to spend like if i try to do really good.  
00:13:07 Speaker 1  
and that's usually what i do i like want to do really good job for my proposals i will spend anywhere from like five to ten hours per client right understanding the project requirements doing deep research on what solutions are there might be what components there are what are new technology out there that can accomplish it being creative and then building a solution architecture right and then going back and forth to make sure we're aligned and then building a proposal etc that takes way too long so what we did is we repurposed cloud code itself to.  
00:13:40 Speaker 1  
have something we call the proposal builder so it has commands where so the cool thing is that it's constantly ingesting new uh meetings, So all the meetings are immediately ingested, right? Initial discovery, all the meetings are initially ingested. And then all the chats, you know, WhatsApp chats, Upwork message chats, email threads ingested.  
00:14:13 Speaker 1  
And anything they send us, right, any documents, any Excel sheets, they send us. And then we have a command called synthesis where it just synthesizes raw information into organized stuff and then creates this, stop me at any point, by the way, creates this client discovery notes. And then we can do a deep research, do pre-research, where the system literally reads hundreds of articles online and research papers to understand what's their competitor, what are the tools that's currently out there.  
00:14:46 Speaker 1  
But most of the time, you require a lot of human in the loop. So I ask the right questions. I look at the outputs of it. And there's so many new tools that you have to rethink how to architecture existing systems all the time. But the cool thing is I've created agents to be able to consistently check upstream compatibility checkers. So every single new meeting that comes in, the transcriptions are immediately uploaded, and we do a synthesize of all the information, and it automatically updates all documents.  
00:15:25 Speaker 1  
right the the solution architecture the research if it's insufficient research uh the project requirements can be updated right if i'm on the face of negotiating with the client and we look at the estimates so we also have a command to do the estimates if we're on the phase of doing estimates we have uh the scope right we might reduce the scope to fit their budget right once we do the scope the ai agent automatically back propagates the project requirements to match this reduction in the scope you know what i'm saying and then forward propagates to make sure um the.  
00:16:00 Speaker 1  
solution architecture is aligned with the with the new scope um, Right. So everything is automatic and it saves us time. Now I do like maybe five or six proposals in parallel and I finish them in an hour. You know, that's like 20, 30x reduction in my time.  
00:16:19 Speaker 2  
And what you should take you five to six hours to do one now takes you 30 minutes less.  
00:16:26 Speaker 1  
Yeah, yeah. And we do it really, really well. Right. Because humans can't research a hundred articles and synthesize all that information and constantly update every single meeting to make sure all the knowledge are contained and persisted. Right. But let me tell you another cool thing. Right. So not only are we revolutionizing how we create proposals and create solution architecture, but we also include it here, generate level of a prototype. Literally at the stage of creating a solution architecture, this AI comes up with what is the.  
00:16:58 Speaker 1  
Highest ROI demonstration we can produce. Most of the time, it's UI, user interface front end associated. So this command actually creates a very comprehensive prompt to actually create the UI with literally a single press of a button and one shot. So this is not iteration. So they can create prompt much better because it has all the contextual information. Right. And we send that prototype over even before, like literally right after the first meeting before we get any payments.  
00:17:36 Speaker 1  
Right. So not only are we revolutionizing and changing the way we write proposals, we're also changing the way sales is done. Right. No one has ever heard of, hey, we're going to create you a prototype approval concept like after the first meeting. And before you even pay this to me money, I tell I talk to some of my other consultancy friends and they're like, what the fuck are you doing? Like, why are you spending that much time? That's super aggressive. I was like, no, it's not. Actually, it takes me maybe 30 seconds to click that button to generate a prototype. And once I sent them that prototype, the conversion is up the roof. You know, no one's doing that. Let me show you a prototype.  
00:18:19 Speaker 2  
That's very impressive. Because essentially, you know, one of the things you're actually doing is you're taking the decision making process away from the client. Because essentially, if you already give them a prototype, right, before they've even had time to think about it. I mean, You already have something to work with exactly then clients have sometimes the same Oh, we still to talk about it. We'll see we'll come back to you.  
00:18:52 Speaker 2  
We as a team need to sit together and come up with an a frame of what we're looking for, I.  
00:18:59 Speaker 1  
Appreciate that you understand. Yeah I appreciate you understand because not only is it, Well, not only is it changing the way you do sales, right? They basically they're like, holy shit. This guy has built like 50% of this project over it. Like how are we not gonna go with them, you know, and, Number two is that we aligned on the front end like the features and functionalities like we built this literally with a single prompt Right one prompt and it built it and there's some changes. I just ask you what's next because it's already done.  
00:19:35 Speaker 1  
You know, like, this is a single prompt from a single meeting, right? They look at it, they're like, holy shit, this is exactly what I want. If it's not exactly what you want, sure. Let's, we have, you can sign, you can sign the engagement letter, you can sign the proposal, and you can start tweaking it to exactly how you want, right? That's even before we migrate or transfer this project to our engineers. This is all sales process, right? Right? The sales process doesn't end until we are aligned on an actual front-end user interface.  
00:20:10 Speaker 1  
that the client agrees on. You know what I'm saying? So everything else is just back-end.  
00:20:16 Speaker 2  
What a lot of people actually forget, right? They don't understand the psychology and mechanics of the sales process. They don't understand that you could have, I could have a meeting with you, and you could tell me what I want. But then even after that, right, even if we agree, I now need to be able to communicate what we communicated to the rest of the team.  
00:20:43 Speaker 3  
Yeah.  
00:20:43 Speaker 2  
That alone is a challenge, right? Because unless I have something practical to show, it's highly conceptual. And what I am and what the team understands are often two different things.  
00:20:56 Speaker 1  
Exactly.  
00:20:57 Speaker 2  
Yeah? Yeah. They have nothing to work with, right.   
00:20:59 Speaker 1  
Exactly.  
00:21:00 Speaker 2  
And then you'll say, okay, but I'm not quite sure about, again, that's all part of the mechanics of a sale that slows the process down. There's indecision. There's a need for this and that. You have no idea how. turbocharged. This is beyond turbocharging, a process you're doing with this, because, now when you're saying to a client, hey, we've spoken, right? Even if you're unsure, here's what I was talking about. Yeah, look at it. Yeah. What do you think? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Share with your team. What do you guys think? And the nice thing is, you have something.  
00:21:34 Speaker 2  
to iterate, you have something that the collective might actually focus on, and know that we're all talking the same language, because part of the biggest problem in building anything or doing anything is that everyone has their own ideas of what something means. Exactly. And sometimes people don't realize that the inertia that comes from that is that things, never get started, because how do we even know what we're talking about? Yeah, yeah.   
00:22:05 Speaker 1  
exactly. Oh, my God, I'm getting goosebumps, man. I love that we're so aligned. So yes, I agree with that, right? The sales process. um you know we have something present and they can show their team they can show their executives like hey this is this is look good right i i was i'm on both side of this table right i built systems before i also act as fractional cto for a handful of firms already right some startups some raising funds and when we hire uh development development teams the biggest issue like you said.  
00:22:36 Speaker 1  
is the sales thing right but also it would take weeks if not months to get aligned on a figma design before even development happens right so i'm like yo uh-huh we understand we underestimate.  
00:22:52 Speaker 2  
the importance of the visual when we're talking uh-huh we underestimate the importance of the visual when we're talking because i have a meeting with you when i'm visualizing from what we've spoken about when i speak to my colleague what they're visualizing what everyone's doing everybody has different visualizations of what we're talking about, before even the functionality okay which wanted to do this okay that's a great but how the, visualization of the mechanics by showing them something what you're actually doing is actually.  
00:23:24 Speaker 2  
you're harnessing a lot of things you're punishing uh their minds the visualization the concentration and you're creating unanimity on on a single point yeah yeah and whatever that just explodes the decision-making process yes yeah and it saves them it saves them time.  
00:23:46 Speaker 1  
right it saves the client time they're like holy you've actually have already built the front end right like if i go into anyone else, They just have to rebuild that, you know? And number two thing is I wanted to say is it builds confidence in what we're capable of, right? One of the biggest issues hiring a development team is that they say, oh, we can do everything. We can do it in this time. But can they actually do it, right? I'm showing them that, yeah, fuck yeah, I can actually do it. We have agentic systems and we have done R\&D for internal processes where you can deliver extremely fast, right?  
00:24:17 Speaker 1  
And you can trust me because I've already fucking built part of it for you before you even pay me. I'm that confident.  
00:24:24 Speaker 2  
100%, 100%. I think I was talking to somebody who was, what is it, a couple of years ago. She was working with corporates, building websites for them, right? Corporate websites for them. And I said, look. try to either buy themes on up on a theme forest or uh buy things from anywhere, and instead of sending a proposal send a completed site with dummy links yeah and eight or ten legal.  
00:25:01 Speaker 2  
websites so the client is some individualized and i said your conversion rate would change dramatically it does it does you know what i i like i need to change that but i like the idea of that one i like okay you want that okay you can push that we can pull that i can do that i can use the home screen for that i can use you like that menu okay we use the menu from that side you're already giving clients something to do yes you said oh my god you changed my business, You know, if you get an email about a website, you have no idea what they're talking about,  
00:25:34 Speaker 2  
what you have in your head, what I have in my head. Exactly.  
00:25:37 Speaker 1  
Yes.  
00:25:38 Speaker 2  
These are things that you've done very well. Thanks.  
00:25:41 Speaker 1  
Well, can I tell you one last thing? So this is something, so we have the proposal, right? This is something we built too. One click to generate an interactive proposal, right? And it's very ROI focused, you know, what is the ROI investment, you know, understanding your challenge. Things are clickable, and we're going to add visual diagrams to everything. Oh, you're saving this much money. What is the infrastructure? Like, what are the features, you know, that we're using? What are the features? Business ROIs.  
00:26:12 Speaker 1  
Look at this, how much you're making, right? How we deliver that value, the things that we're going to build for you. This is one click. We have an AI system that builds this interactive proposal and send it to our clients. People are insanely impressed. They're like, holy shit, this is beautiful, you know? And this is easier than manually writing proposals and sending them a static Google Doc or PDF, right? Everything is in here. So that's something we just finished building early this week.  
00:26:44 Speaker 1  
and we're starting to deploy to our new projects, proposals. um so okay one more thing okay this is an idea we haven't built it yet but we we are extending this okay all right follow me on this we're extending this to a business builder right we're talking about contextualization every thing all slack messages all internal meetings you know um all of our meetings here all the business overall business strategy annual planning competitive intelligence all departments are in here decision framework.  
00:27:18 Speaker 1  
core business foundations financial model everything is in here right could you imagine the applications we can do right like every single meeting that's updated hey um who's doing who's which team member is doing well which project should we work on right we basically have a collection of every single information about our business and how to forecast, how to make decisions, who should we hire, right? We can do like weekly team evaluations based on this.  
00:27:50 Speaker 1  
We have an AI system that does business coaching, if you want. I can't even fathom the possibility of what we can do with this, right.   
00:28:02 Speaker 2  
So essentially, what that entire system does is it encapsulates your entire business under various parameters, and you can then essentially output whatever you want in terms of reports and analysis.  
00:28:18 Speaker 1  
Wow. So Zane, this is what I'm saying, right? I'm not someone that digs, digs, digs deeper into one thing anymore. I am, at my heart, an entrepreneur. And at my heart, a creative engineer who is leveraging the most advanced AI technology that comes up literally like, you know, a week or two, a month ago to completely redesign how business is done, right? And to completely increase the efficiency of the department, the sales pipeline, the marketing pipeline, right?  
00:28:55 Speaker 1  
We're creating, we're updating the proposal builder to automatically build case studies after a project is done.  
00:29:04 Speaker 2  
Okay, so you're, let me see, let me see. Are you like a chief business synthesis officer or something.   
00:29:17 Speaker 1  
I'm the CEO for my firm, but I've done CTO work, a handful of them.  
00:29:22 Speaker 2  
No, no, no, I'm saying more like synthesis, right? Because it looks as though you're synthesizing, you know, technologies to create business solutions, right.   
00:29:32 Speaker 1  
That sounds about right, yeah, that's a good title.  
00:29:36 Speaker 2  
Yeah, because you're, because I'm just thinking about, you know, I'm thinking about, okay, look, let me ask you a question, right? Here's something, right? Like, you have a lot of skills, right? And you speak well, you would present to VC, ETC. So, we want to put a team together of about two or three really good people, right? We'll do all the dog work, don't worry about anything, you guys can put your feet up, we'll do all the dog work and talk to all the investors. Once they're ready, then you guys will talk to them. We're trying to raise about $25 to $50 million as a minimum, okay?  
00:30:09 Speaker 2  
Now, And to scale really fast, okay? But not one thing. So that's why I'm so happy I'm having this meeting with you because data annotation is just the entry, right? But we are interested in essentially one is distillation, right? Distillation. We want to know what's happening because AI has a distillation issue. We want to know what can be done because if you watch the video I sent you,  
00:30:42 Speaker 2  
there's a lot of specialization happening now. In medical, in this, that, and this. So, again, someone like yourself could be good at building teams because you know the different fields. You know what I'm saying? Yes, sir. You've been into genomics. You've been into that. So we have a number of people that are very qualified. We may end up working with only two or three of them, right? I'll share their CVs and strictest competency to look at, right? There are many different skill sets.  
00:31:12 Speaker 2  
and what we want to do is to just have a team you know um you continue doing what you're doing yeah don't let us ignore you work with your company and they say you know that you're part of our team and then one and i'll tell you who we're talking to okay we're drawing businesses, and once they come back to us and we need to set up meetings etc um we set this thing up because what we're saying is that if okay let me ask you a question right we don't want you to um.  
00:31:44 Speaker 2  
as a result of engaging with us and working with us as part of our team, we don't want your circumstances to be compromised in any way right okay we still want you to be fully covered because we only use it in a fully funded operation um.  
00:32:17 Speaker 1  
I'm going to be completely frank with you, Zane, because I believe in honesty and transparency. I really like what I'm doing right now. It's a lot of fun. The creative aspect of it, you know, just uprooting and completely redefining how business is done and just playing around with new tools. I have a business partner that I really like, and I have a team that I really trust and have been working with for a while.  
00:32:50 Speaker 1  
I have people asking me about equity and being their partner. literally every other day, but I think, Zane, I really, really like, I haven't, I've yet to find someone that actually thinks about this on the same page with the amount of experience that you have, right, where I feel like we're really aligned in, like, the disruptions that we can create with.  
00:33:17 Speaker 2  
the systems. You were talking to you, essentially, it's almost as though the vision, instead of thinking about you and your team, yeah, continuing and still being part of something, do you see what I'm saying? Oh, okay. Oh, yeah, I mean, because, because.  
00:33:52 Speaker 2  
If we think about it, right, if we can scale up what you're doing, in terms of all the inventive stuff you're doing, as still part of something that we're doing, right, I'm just curious to find out, like, let me ask you a question, like, right now, with what you're doing and your operation that you guys are in with your partner, right, how do you value that presently? And what would work?  
00:34:51 Speaker 2  
Having someone like you in there and your skill sets and your team, what you're doing, it's essentially what we're talking about to investors to say, look, our main focus is data annotation and agenda labeling annotation, right? But in that same process, within the business, we're doing this and this. We're already doing this. We have demos. Do you see what I'm saying.   
00:35:14 Speaker 1  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
00:35:16 Speaker 2  
In a way that then allows you. To be part of this bigger thing, and still have your thing, and somehow you find... Do you see what I'm saying.   
00:35:27 Speaker 1  
Oh, yeah. Music to my ears, Zane. I'm in. I'm down. Well, can I also just... Yeah, yeah, can I also just, like, be vulnerable and tell you what's going on in my head.   
00:35:37 Speaker 3  
Okay.  
00:35:38 Speaker 1  
You know, we're creating such cool stuff every single day, and we're leveraging the coolest shit, but we're fucking frying small fish right now, Zane. We're looking at Upwork for small clients. You know, we do it really fucking well. People don't have money in Upwork. We're, like, negotiating costs and shit. We're doing all this stuff, passing all the savings down to the client, but they still want more. You know, we have a vertical that we're very involved with, immigration law firms, but they also don't have too much money. A lot of them are just small fish, right?  
00:36:09 Speaker 1  
So we're showing them these demos, and we're like... How do we scale, you know, we have so much potential, so much capacity to do greater things, but we're just fucking frying small fish left and right. And we truly believe the future of business is fully AI-native and integrated, right? And we're building that right now. This is almost a prototype thing, Zane. We're building this.  
00:36:35 Speaker 2  
What you've shown me is a prototype. Because what happened is I reached out to the guy who built, what's it called now? It was called Moldbot, right.   
00:36:52 Speaker 1  
Right, right, right.  
00:36:53 Speaker 2  
Yeah, and I wanted to know because one of the things that we do, that was separate. It's just to reach out to him and say, listen, would he be looking to raise capital? Because we have a number of people, one or two people I spoke to said, do you know this guy? I said, no, I can find out. He says, well, if you can find out, we can definitely throw money at him. But he said he doesn't want any money, yeah? He said, yeah, he looked and he said, yeah. He looked at me and said he didn't want any money and I said okay fine, let me see, let me see, what's it? Yeah, we reached out to him because we thought, because I saw his presentation and I've seen a lot of people talk about what Claude Barthes is doing, I like the fact that he did the integration with, what is it, with the likes of what?  
00:37:48 Speaker 2  
With the likes of, um... with the likes of what is it with the likes of um you know you get a whatsapp you can oh yeah the fact that he what's not i thought that was so cool yeah yeah like what yeah it's just yeah it's just like i just what's up my bot yeah and um and yeah so i i spoke to him i missed i sent him a few messages so message me he didn't want any of it i was like okay no no let us know you're looking to raise great money because oh yeah because yeah.  
00:38:24 Speaker 2  
yeah yeah at least he was polite enough to come back that's him yeah i just didn't you know call me you know i said uh you know we can help you what happened to you happened is i spoke to somebody he said listen we could throw a lot of money at this guy oh then i got someone else who said we could throw a lot of money at this guy you know i don't know so i reached out to him i said listen buddy there are people trying to throw money at you because initially one guy said, he said and i said how much i don't know they're trying dollars because something that can change business and can be a leader we can throw money at them and help them to scale.  
00:38:58 Speaker 2  
but then and i said so yeah and then i got a call from someone at softbank who was saying uh even up to 500 million i said hey do you want to have a call he says no i'm not paying an audience and raising i said okay he's not interested in half a billion dollars look it's insane initially i said 30 to 100 million dollars right then what happened i spoke to the guys at um um softbank um no there's a company.  
00:39:30 Speaker 2  
in um in the uae yeah it's uh kind of state-owned and they said listen, we would want someone like that to be in dubai we can put 100 to 200 million dollars and develop this thing we want leadership from dubai because of them it's they probably they stay at home right so they've got lots of money and they already have an ai company so it says yeah yeah this was then yeah then i got the next day uh from someone from where this was 3 6 a.m from 9 to 3 a.m i got a.  
00:40:02 Speaker 2  
call from someone from one uh from so far we said uh who is he talking to i said maybe he's talking to you guys he says i said no and it says i'll check he says but we can put up to half a billion dollars if he's if the leader's going to change that way business is down we can over time put a lot of money in my center and he says noticing raising i said no so it's a small world um and we reach out to people try to be proactive yeah um yeah because so let me kind of show you what we.  
00:40:33 Speaker 2  
so right now um. What I was going to say to you is this, is that the way we're thinking about this is to have an open-ended conversation right now, when we're just having a conversation, it's not about achieving anything, if we can, the better, but just to say, what, you know, just to sort of bounce the balls up in the air and see what works, but one of the things I really like about what you're doing, is that you are there pitching with what we're trying to do, because essentially, we want the business itself to not just be, and we.  
00:41:08 Speaker 2  
need to show that to our, to investors, that listen, whilst we're coming in with, you know, data annotation and data labeling yeah and we're going to you know be a core focus of what we do, we understand the real outfit and then you can come in and show what show all the different tricks you're working on yeah and truth in the look i already have this system i think the system can be scaled for business uh we see this um yeah and we can you know do some demonstrations we're more yeah we are very much ready to go right then the conversation is uh.  
00:41:44 Speaker 2  
excuse the language yes please up work yeah he's scared you know this is something that we can um scale we want to do bring in a team that not only that enhances our current offering, whilst we're looking at avenues to scale right so again that's a product ready to go so that's what i'm saying that. There's so much money involved in this game that there's not money for everybody, you know what I'm saying to you, there's not money for everybody, you know, things are done right, but what you can't get with a lot of people is like, you have deep AI expertise in addition to business skills, which is what's paying off, because I'm sure when you left tech to get into business, you never left tech, you never left business.  
00:42:40 Speaker 2  
So I thought one day you'd be having this kind of conversation.  
00:42:42 Speaker 1  
Yes, sir. Yep. Yeah.  
00:42:45 Speaker 2  
So now, what I'm saying to you is this, think about, think about a situation where we could have your operation within our operation, but scaled up. So you guys are still winning. You're paying on a bigger plate. We went by having. having you guys in, with your skills and expertise, right? In addition to that, in addition to AI and data labeling,  
00:43:18 Speaker 2  
we also have what? We also have your, I think you said something very interesting about...  
00:43:25 Speaker 1  
Just like business operations redesign or like disrupting business workflow, yeah. Something like that, in that ballpark? Yeah, because I think it's AI-native business building, AI-native business.  
00:43:45 Speaker 2  
Yeah, you said, yeah, I don't sell AI, I make it work for firms, you know, I'm drawing in data, I've been in efficiency for the past decade. I think just this alone, that alone is also a very strong selling point to what? To VC and say, listen, this is what we want to do for business. So we want to say, sure, we're working, we're getting into data labeling, data optimization labeling, right? And you talk about all these schools, workers, you know, and that's all very important.  
00:44:16 Speaker 2  
But I think also, there's a lot there, but I highlighted something you put out as a lower down in your CV, yeah, where you talk about the various skill sets that you would bring in. And I'm just thinking, thinking out loud, right, that in a situation. In a situation like this, right, if we're. yeah if we're if yeah oh yeah this year i would contribute as an interim functional executive focus on launch base architecture defining annotation governance aligning leading robin's uh models and.  
00:44:49 Speaker 2  
product teams excelling kpas that tier one plans can trust these are you know so and then also you say i mean is that it's a whole senior day that matter with over a decade's experience in operating ai assistance, regulated high environments including healthcare finance finance legal so so you're bringing this breadth, and uh and depth which i think is crucial and i'm thinking um how.  
00:45:21 Speaker 2  
your team right and what you guys are doing right, how could we swallow you into what we're doing because that already helps because that means that now we have a. does that make sense yeah to um what is your website.  
00:46:32 Speaker 1  
yeah it's um.  
00:46:36 Speaker 2  
Nick's right. Okay. So this is this is ours. It's not it's not funny already. Yeah.  
00:46:40 Speaker 3  
Can you hear me? Yes, sir. Yep. Yeah. No, I'm sorry. I'm saying.  
00:47:17 Speaker 2  
It's on the dev side that we just are finalizing the content for but what else is saying that thinking out loud I think what would be useful from talking to you. You seem to you seem to want to be involved, If you can bring your team along with you.  
00:47:35 Speaker 1  
Yes, sir.  
00:47:36 Speaker 2  
Am I assuming.   
00:47:37 Speaker 1  
Yes, sir.  
00:47:39 Speaker 2  
So from your perspective, right? Not now, but something to think about. Just think, reflect on it. Talk to your partner and say, how would you, what would you guys, what sort of buy-in would we have to have you guys in.   
00:48:06 Speaker 1  
Yeah, let's... Sure.  
00:48:08 Speaker 2  
What's your partner's background.   
00:48:10 Speaker 1  
What's my what.   
00:48:12 Speaker 2  
Your partner's background.  
00:48:13 Speaker 1  
Oh, his name is Gabe. I met him in grad school. He did computer science at Georgia Tech, which is like number two in the country or something. And after that he went to IBM for a bit and then has always been an entrepreneur for like the past 10-15 years, Has built has a was a CTO for a startup that got acquired. He built his own SaaS that also got acquired by Georgia Tech.  
00:48:45 Speaker 1  
Absolutely brilliant guy. Yeah.  
00:48:50 Speaker 2  
So again, look let me ask you a question right? What you guys are doing now, right if we. if we come to you and, And we're training and having raised 25 million dollars at the time and say, how can we work with you? What would be the way that we can work with you? Have you guys having you guys as part of our team and trying to do something.  
00:49:21 Speaker 2  
how because like i said there's enough money to go around here and if we're thinking there's enough scale and also um we almost want to see our business as an incubator right it don't make any sense right yeah either when we're trying to try to be hyper um entrepreneur right we're trying to see ourselves as a sort of incubator accelerator right right so what we can um well we well we can spawn different businesses that come out of it does it make sense yeah yeah.  
00:49:57 Speaker 2  
yeah so we might launch actually the data annotation but uh this is part of shimba and then um within shimba we're developing this uh business um what do you call it what do you call your.  
00:50:11 Speaker 1  
business solution oh we call it a business builder it's not the best day but yeah yeah we built a.  
00:50:18 Speaker 2  
business builder and, and then look whether the business you know this can spawn this this business builder can either be spawned out um you know and attract its own capital uh you know to grow to grow independently right so it's just a number just just think it out loud remember we entrepreneur right right so we just have to basically um kind of put things out there and try and see um see what works because um well.  
00:50:52 Speaker 1  
well zane i'd like i like the idea right like we talked about this is a prototype what we're building here my whole business is basically a prototype for this business and proposal builder, So I like the idea of you guys being an incubator or an accelerator, and maybe we can get some sort of funding and to continue marketing it and continue building the system up and maybe going to other verticals for our consultancy just to make sure this business builder is robust. And then once it's at a stage where it's robust and usable and we can add other businesses in here, maybe start selling it, then we can kind of fundraise together.  
00:51:29 Speaker 1  
I like that idea. But of course, I have to talk to my business partner about it. Maybe there are other avenues of partnering, but that could be something.  
00:51:37 Speaker 2  
What about what we're doing? When you come in, right.   
00:51:46 Speaker 1  
I can come in as a paid chief business synthesis officer to start with, right? And then once we start working together, go through a dating phase of getting to know each other and how we work together, right? And we can kind of talk about other potentials.  
00:52:03 Speaker 2  
So, since you come in as a business scientist officer, right, so your job will be one to optimize whatever we can't be doing, as well as developing, as well as rapidly reviewing AI solutions to deploy, to explore the development of new business, what new businesses within the business. So, what I'm saying to you guys, right, how much will be required, once we do that, and we hire you, how much will be required to then incubate your existing business.   
00:52:47 Speaker 1  
Talk to your partner. I'll talk to my partner, yeah, but we're pretty lean. We're all pretty lean, so I don't foresee it being an insane amount. Definitely not half a billion. But...  
00:53:01 Speaker 2  
that's a crazy number no here's what happens right um i don't know if you read if you read last 16 i think uh az16 or um every now and then yeah they raised the race how much the race uh i forget one of the lightest races in vc ever yeah in in vc ever they have so much money right remember i was talking to somebody um and you were saying to me yeah az16 they got a.  
00:53:33 Speaker 2  
they got they got yeah there is there is 15 billion dollars yeah is az16 so they've got so much money to deploy that's why people are willing to rate half a million dollar half a billion dollar chance right because they would say to their um to their um, Hey, listen, we had to, this is a groundbreaking solution, right, and it's got a wide adoption and it's worth developing, whereas in general, today, someone sent me a link, I think 11\.  
00:54:10 Speaker 2  
lads, right, they earned $800 million, right, an $100 million valuation, despite the fact, that you cannot get free tools from China that are as good as 11 lads, you know what I'm saying to you.   
00:54:28 Speaker 3  
Right, right.  
00:54:28 Speaker 2  
Yeah, but they're, yeah, so, but, you know, I think it's a Series D or Series C, there is the upper billing, right, because what I'm trying to say to you is that there's a lot of money in the space, and I think what we need, which is the most valuable tool for us right now, is a core skill set that people like you bring, and then what we want to do is to push the ideas. And, you know, we'll then do an agreement, you guys will talk, you know, you wouldn't just be hired, you'd be, at any point that we're working with you, you'd be paid, like you'd be, there's no squared equity required, yeah.   
00:55:05 Speaker 1  
Good, good, yeah.  
00:55:06 Speaker 2  
I don't want to be clear about that, sorry, but I should be clear about that. So, we're saying, continue with what you're doing. At the point of us raising, is the point that you're engaged. Do you see what I'm saying? At the point where we have, like, money, is where you'd engage. just pre-raise, just in terms of meetings with investors, does that make sense.   
00:55:28 Speaker 3  
Yeah.  
00:55:28 Speaker 2  
Yeah? Just meetings, that's the only thing you would do, yeah? Just meetings with investors, but the agreement that you would have with yourselves, is that you'd be coming in as a key team member, right? Okay? And not only would you be well compensated for, right? Well compensated, but you'd also, you'd also have a huge upside in terms of stock options, right? Right. So you invest in and make sure that the success of this entity.  
00:55:59 Speaker 2  
that we're trying to build into Unicorn is something that benefits you substantially. Yeah. Yeah, so one does, because, you know... As you know yourself, this isn't like in any other boom. There'll be few winners. There's a lot of noise, but there'll be few winners. And I think we want the few winners by doing the things right and by being very targeted. We each want to talk to A16, we want to talk to SoftBank, we want them to say no to us. Yeah, we want SoftBank to say no to us. We want general partners to say no to us, not.  
00:56:30 Speaker 2  
people with the real money. Do you see what I'm saying, Jude? That's what really, because they're the people that we can actually build something with. So we're simply saying, we've spoken today. I'm so excited with this conversation because when you were speaking to me, I was like, this is absolutely brilliant. He's actually saying exactly what I would almost be saying.  
00:56:51 Speaker 1  
Yes, thank you for like resonating with me. Yeah.  
00:56:55 Speaker 2  
Yeah, no. So look, so going forwards, right, we've had this call, is to try to say, look, We want you to consume what you're doing, we want you to be part of our team, we will do all the pitching, but separately, we would need you to create a pitch deck for the stuff you have.  
00:57:19 Speaker 1  
Will do.  
00:57:21 Speaker 2  
You know, like your business builder, ETC, because we will present those business builders and everything else as something that's incubated within what we're doing. Does that make sense.   
00:57:31 Speaker 1  
Yep. Makes sense.  
00:57:32 Speaker 2  
So, what then that does is that you're then able to speak to the VC, yeah, when we line them up, you don't have to lift, put your feet up, yeah, we will do all that with the VC.  
00:57:42 Speaker 1  
Should I just extend my vacation to Hawaii a bit? Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
00:57:48 Speaker 2  
I'm trying to say to you, essentially, we do, our job is to find the tea, like what we're doing now, talking to competent people like yourselves, and then finding the money.  
00:57:59 Speaker 3  
Yeah.  
00:58:00 Speaker 2  
Right? So we will do that, right? You can put your feet up, all I'm saying is when you're ready, when investors are hot, but something's up, that's when you will then be engaging, right.   
00:58:10 Speaker 3  
Yes, sir.  
00:58:10 Speaker 2  
So we'll do the initial thing for the data labeling, yeah, data attention, yeah. Where you're, you know, a business and a software within part of that group, but you'll also have this thing that you have. Now, who would then need to talk after you talk to your partner to say, how do we integrate you guys into what we're doing.   
00:58:38 Speaker 3  
Yeah.   
00:58:40 Speaker 2  
Yeah, because at the end of the day, we want to scale whatever's going on so that we get things moving.  
00:58:46 Speaker 1  
Let's do it. Zeng, I have to go soon, but can you send me more information? You said your website's still on container construction, but do you have any more information? I have this meeting recorded, so I'll synthesize this meeting transcript and talk to you later.  
00:59:00 Speaker 2  
Listen, thank you so much, Wei-Tang, for talking to yourselves. And listen, I'm not always an upwork, yeah? But if I am, if you miss me, you can WhatsApp me. Do you have WhatsApp.
