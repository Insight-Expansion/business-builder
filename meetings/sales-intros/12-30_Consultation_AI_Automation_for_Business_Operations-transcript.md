# **12-30 Consultation: AI Automation for Business Operations**

###### 2025-12-30 14:36:09

**00:00:00**  
Other than the actual product we sell, it functions in a pretty straightforward fashion. We have an organizational chart, five full-time people. We have probably about 30 or 40 scenarios in make that actually power the business. We have our CRM and Airtable. And then, yeah, we run ads in new organic social media. So it’s a pretty normal business, to be honest with you. The big elephant in the room right now is AI is starting to screw my margins a bit.

**00:00:31**  
So I have had to get a lot more efficient with my budgets this year. And I was just running through my P\&Ls yesterday. And it took a long time to get a good team in place who can do a lot of this stuff. The thing about that is everything is very obsessively documented. I have SOPs and manuals for literally every single role in the entire business. So I’m going to show you a little bit of that. So there’s a big bit to work from there from an automation perspective too. We’re also not necessarily unfamiliar.

**00:01:04**  
with what can be done automations wise, really kind of embarrassing. Our whole make set up has no open AI plugins running on it whatsoever somehow. So we just haven’t really gotten around to that yet. So yeah, right now I’m just kind of shopping around for partners who would be interested, in trying to help me automate some of these roles. Yeah, not sure exactly how much stuff you guys are doing in the space right now.

**00:01:36**  
to hear. Are you a newer operation? I saw some of you guys reform a meta. That’s really cool. I’ve never actually worked with anybody who worked there, so that’s definitely interesting. You guys newer? Have you been helping people do this for a while? What’s your operation look like? Well, we’ve been around for a while. Speaking of which, Thomas, you look like you’re fucking 25, man. How do you have a fucking SA empire with a million dollar revenue? I’m 31, so I sleep a lot.

**00:02:06**  
But did you start it yourself? It’s like a thing that you did? Wow. Yeah, it was me and one other guy whenever we were in college. college, of course. We used to do this in high school for our friends. And yeah, we got out of college and we were like, wow, we want to get jobs. Like, what else can we do? So we just, you know, we were just good at marketing, honestly. And yeah, it just kind of worked out like that. We really just got lucky with good product market fit and a space where not a lot of people were trying really hard to have a good business.

**00:02:40**  
Thank you, though. I appreciate it. Yeah. Most of it just come from jealousy. So no question. I appreciate it. I didn’t work at Meta. I mean, you got that. That’s pretty fucking cool. So what can I say? Thank you. Thank you. So, right. So I went to a PhD program at Georgia Tech where I met Gabe. He was doing his master’s in software engineering. Georgia Tech is like the number three.

**00:03:10**  
engineering school in the country and it’s like number two for software engineering or something um, after that uh gabe and i i i worked at meta for a couple years uh working with like ai uh systems, machine learning and gabe went through ibm and then kind of like went into the route of just doing like startups he built a lot of his own like software startups he uh worked as an acting cto for several startups some of which have exited he’s also exiting his own startup um and i i just.

**00:03:44**  
kind of so he’s been in the in the game for longer of like building softwares for a consultancy building softwares for other firms i just got into the game maybe three years ago um, And then I left Meta to kind of pursue this full-time and then Gabe and I got together mid this year But both of us has been have had a lot of experience building softwares. I mostly, specialize in like AI and machine learning Algorithms Gabe is like full-stack building softwares all across and then we just merge our expertise together.

**00:04:16**  
Now we focus a lot on like AI softwares, So we’ll be doing this for a while up work most of the time, We get clients outside of up we get we find clients on upward when we get them. We work with them outside, right? That’s why you don’t see a lot of projects and whatnot up there. So it’s not reflective of our experience, but, Let’s see. We, Build actual softwares like code the software’s right? So it’s not just make automation.

**00:04:48**  
Or, right, so that means that there’s basically nothing we can’t solve, right, because we build code from straight up. So we’re not constrained by what make can or cannot do. We can also build user interfaces, dashboards, analytics, basically anything that you can dream of, right, any sort of customization. We can also export make scenarios into your own software builds. So then you have IP for them, right? And you can integrate other tools that make doesn’t natively allow you to integrate. You can integrate newer models, you can create images, right? Anything that’s constrained by make, we can build it for you. And you can also integrate webhooks and whatnot, like everything that needs to be done. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**00:05:45**  
We also have experts in-house. If you really only want to do the make route, we have experts in-house to do that, right? But our bread and butter is just building with code and actually build solid softwares. So what this means is two things, Thomas. One is if you need to go the remake route, we can do that. It might almost be cheaper, more efficient, more ownership of your IP, and more capabilities.

**00:06:16**  
if we just build it from code, right? Because the thing is, we do a lot of R\&D in-house to build. Our specialty is we build an AI system that builds code really fast. So, we have a whole workflow and proprietary tools that we built to build softwares really fast but it has to be code-based, right, because AI can spit out code much better than humans can drag and drop Zapier and make stuff.

**00:06:49**  
So that’s our differentiation between basically anyone else you talk to. So that’s the first one. The second one is, like I said, we own a business. We work as fractional CTOs to do strategies for firms who’s not natively technology-based to help them with their technology roadmap, right. And so basically we can help you with, you know, coming up with additional differentiations, or features to help you combat this, you know, people going into chat GDP for essays instead.

**00:07:24**  
So we have that business experience and not just like coding and building software. And because of that, we also make sure whatever we build for you has the highest ROI. Right. So basically what Gabe and I do all day is we talk to business owners and help them figure out the best solutions, the cheapest, most efficient and highest ROI solutions and help them build it. And we have a lot of business experience, too. Right. So we can use that business insight. Cool. OK. That makes sense. That makes sense. All right. Yeah. Nice. Nice. Well, that’s all really interesting. So, yeah, there is one thing we’ve done a lot of with our business is we’ve documented every process.

**00:08:05**  
I have manuals, 50, 60 pages. So everything is written out exactly as the person has to do it. I imagine that’s probably helpful if you’re looking to develop some type of agent. Yeah. Because you can sort of understand the actual roles and everything. Really, what I’m trying to build here, it doesn’t really even seem to be that complicated. But do you guys just want me to kind of explain it to you here from a top-down perspective? Just to kind of see. All right, cool. That’d be great.

**00:08:36**  
So, yeah, yeah, cool, cool. So I’ll share screen if that’s all right. Right, so it’s the way we have stuff is actually do a lot of stuff through email, interestingly enough, right? Pretty much all of the essays that we get assigned or that essentially we win from clients,

**00:09:06**  
we basically have make route website into email. and then we email them out to a group of writers, right? And we have this all set up through Airtable here. Oops, Daisy, yeah. To where it is actually like, it seems pretty complex to me, but we’ve even built like an algorithm to like decide which writer to choose based on their response times and based on specific subjects.

**00:09:36**  
that they’ve indicated that they can do and it’s all linked up Airtable, right? So we developed this about four or five years ago, really before AI had come on the scene, but it’s still very automation heavy. Essentially what happens is a project will get one, it will then enter into our Airtable here. and then we have humans operating this dashboard right here they will see oh okay like this essay came in to cornell essays this person is trying to get into courthouse and they’re paying us to write their essay crazy right then basically what happens is a draft will automatically be created.

**00:10:12**  
they can go boom send it out to a writer and then that writer will either respond with a confirmation or denial um the draft of the essays are automatically created, No, no, no. Sorry. An email draft can be an order that they should then do. Oh, gotcha, gotcha. So really what we have is we have like a human-in-the-loop system here where somebody is essentially responsible for seeing this draft get created, sending it out. I can’t believe we have one automated app, but go figure.

**00:10:44**  
And then ultimately, they act as a conduit between the writer and the student, right? Really, if a student has a message about a particular project, for instance, it will pop up here on our site. Real quick, this is the site, by the way. Great. Killer site. Yeah, thanks.

**00:11:19**  
So yeah, basically, they will get messages. Sorry, what? Oh, no, I was just saying, this is really impressive, the way how you automate and systematize everything, even before AI was a thing. Oh, yeah, thanks. It’s kind of one of my little passions, honestly. I really just like business systems. It’s just a lot of fun for me. I think that’s probably one of the biggest answers to why you were successful, not just that you’re a marketing guy. Yeah, thank you. There’s a lot of good books about it. There’s a good online biz ops community that I like to contribute to, so it’s just cool.

**00:11:57**  
I’ve always just enjoyed that part of it, too. So anyway, basically, what kind of happens here is we pretty much have… uh our admin team students can chat to uh can chat to us here we essentially have them literally copying and pasting messages off of a website putting them into emails and then sending them to writers however there has to be a human in the loop there because they have to essentially sometimes rewrite the message so that it appears that it is not coming from this so that it removes.

**00:12:29**  
any specific identifying information or that um yeah that that they don’t reveal too much because the writers ultimately don’t know where the work is coming from they’re kind of siloed so basically, human in the middle messages come in here human looks at them ensures everything’s okay and then boom sends them over to the writer and then basically is the contact point between those two people, I believe that could just be boiled down to, like, a good AI implementation with solid rules built in and then probably a human in the loop for the first, you know, few weeks just to make sure that all the messages going back and forth are okay.

**00:13:13**  
But, yeah, that would be the main thing there. And then, really, there are other roles that they play, but that is the primary one. It’s essentially acting as the midway point between writer and student message essentially received. Okay, it goes over here, and then it would have to go to whatever system here and then have a set of rules applied to it, rewrite it in a way that is just appropriate for either party, and then to have it get delivered.

**00:13:45**  
um we have obviously api access to the sites it’s our site so you know we can pull data straight off of that um we haven’t automated sending messages out to the writer in question as well um that’s a little bit beyond my scope of understanding just above my wheelhouse to how we would do that but obviously everybody’s email is in our air table air table is aware of all of these writers individually so yeah that’s really kind of the the big crux of it um there are additional like.

**00:14:19**  
uh management tasks that those people will do specifically whenever they’re deciding, um how to assign work or how to respond to certain messages that a writer might have because sometimes it does just require on some level of domain specific expertise um but that is basically it from like a you know five minute perspective, i love it, Yeah, so you’re building a kind of like an orchestrator and decision maker agent, like you said, that besides doing some menial tasks of removing private personalized information, it would have to decide on a couple of different things based on like, there’s certain, I guess, certain scenarios or certain situations.

**00:15:13**  
Situations. Yeah. What’s key here is something you mentioned that in the beginning, maybe more decisions will go to the human. There needs to be a human in the loop. That’s number one. Number two is AI needs to almost be able to assess how much uncertainty there is on that decision. Right. So it can be like, oh, I’m like 99% certain this is good to go. Right. And if it’s trained well, then it’s like we can just bypass it. Right. But anything below 80%, we can have to have the humans review it.

**00:15:44**  
And on top of that, like a machine learning loop. Right. That’s something that’s not generative AI. That’s traditional machine learning of like, hey, if I send out, all of all of the scenarios or that’s, you know, less than 80%, whatever, a certainty or less than 90% certainty. Here are all the ones that was approved. And here are all the ones that was edited. And here is the output of the edits from the human in the loop from the human. Let me incorporate that into the training model.

**00:16:15**  
So now I can retrain my certainty level. Right. And then over time, it just gets better and better and better at doing that. So that’s a pure machine learning system that you cannot build with automation tools. Even human in the loop. You, it might be a human in the loop, you may be able to be built with make depending on what type of channel you want to incorporate, right? Do you want to use WhatsApp or emails or so that might be done. But then it’s really complicated to make like a robust decisioning agent. Okay, in an orchestrator on top of that, with Zapier, especially with Zapier, that’d be really hard. But we can build it with our code because we can build it pretty easily with our system.

**00:17:06**  
Because we have built multi agent orchestration systems before. Cool. One of one of the ones we built is for the largest immigration law firm in Dallas. And it’s basically a like a lead lead qualification agent that takes in about 1000 leads a day. And especially because it’s with like the law space it needs to be pristine, right?

**00:17:36**  
So we have like sub agents when what it’s a multi-agent exist, and we have an orchestrated that decides Okay, what part of the message goes to what agent right so you can do the qualification it can do a payment It can do booking it could do question and answering, And then you have another agent that basically evaluates if the messages are kosher and we’re not like I’ll put it bullshit Right if we if it is then it returns and do the whole thing, But yeah multi-agent systems, it will be really hard to build with make.

**00:18:06**  
Another thing Thomas is that all like we’re like we’re very good with code and then we’re very good Are you seeing AI to build code? So at this point like for us like code is no code basically, Sometimes it was just way easier for me, Using cloud code rather than having to click around like a million menus on make or whatever.

**00:18:56**  
Checkout process to the point where they don’t know that there’s an agent doing it. Maybe you incorporate some slang, vary the message response time, something like that. I’m assuming everyone’s done that because that just seems like such a no-brainer for like an implementation of that’s literally what we built for the law firm right oh everyone’s doing it but not everyone’s doing it good doing it well because like I said it can be really really complicated depending on the level of qualification so it’s it’s a it’s it’s interesting it’s um it’s a push and pull between flexibility and like deterministic outputs versus like flexibility right and you kind of have to play around it’s like.

**00:19:35**  
somewhat of an art um if it’s too rigid then it’s not like conversational but sometimes it might just like spit out bullshit right um so there we played around with a lot of this trade-off and figure out um the best way to do it but but the the stuff that we built for the law firm is text based mostly so it’s integrated to instagram facebook tiktok uh website chat text messages um all goes through the same ai agent yeah, Yeah, that’s cool. That’s cool. And like…

**00:20:09**  
Because what we do is like, obviously, we have we have a lot less qualification than like a law firm, obviously. Honestly, my existing admin setup is it’s like I have people in the Philippines and I have people in South Africa, and I’ve just given them a manual and said, Hey, here you go. And then I train them a little bit. But often what they’ll do is they’ll chat with students whenever like an order comes in half the time, no matter what the subject is, just because we have someone who can do everything. I’ll be like, Hey, take this like description of the assignment that the student posts, go put it into chat. See how it claims that it can do it well, just because I’m not confident in our team that we have someone who can do it right. And then they’ll basically say, huh, okay. So for instance, if it’s like, you know, write me an essay about Martin Luther King, right? Oftentimes, they’re responsible include something like, I would love to write this essay about Martin Luther King for you. He was a super cool guy, you know, so sad he got assassinated that year. And then this thing that happened after it. So it like shows some level of domain expertise to to kind of inspire confidence.

**00:21:09**  
So I’ll be like, Hey, take this like description of the assignment that the student posts, go put it into chat. And then they’ll say, Hey, take this like description of the assignment that the student posts, go put it into chat. And then they’ll say, Hey, take this like description of the assignment that the student posts, go put it into chat. And then they’ll say, Hey, take this like description of the assignment that the student posts, go put it into chat. And then they’ll say, Hey, take this like description of the assignment that the student posts, go put it into chat. And then they’ll say, Hey, take this like description of the assignment that the student posts, go put it into chat. And then they’ll say, Hey, take this like description of the assignment that the student posts, go put it into chat. And then they’ll say, Hey, take this like description of the assignment that the student posts, go put it into chat. And then they’ll say, Hey, take this like description of, while still looking like a real person um and then oh interesting you’re talking about you’re talking about this is for the chat with the potential buyer right and your virtual assistant oh okay okay this is another thing you know you know we’re actually building for a client right now something like this but for live calls like some calls really no yeah yeah instead of like uh text um text chats is for like live calls interesting so like it will will the agent speak.

**00:21:44**  
like for live calls or just kind of tell them what to say i’ll tell them what to say no it doesn’t i mean it gives you feedback it gives you like it’s uh live transcribing the call and it gives you live feedback i mean you could almost try to like sell that as part of your services right like hey we can help students write stuff but also do interviews or, you know college interviews or something i don’t know yeah potentially potentially um that would be really cool because like i i don’t know if you guys have ever had like sales jobs before but like.

**00:22:18**  
there’s all these methodologies like jordan belford has one way of doing it jeremy minor is another way of doing it i always thought it’d be really cool if i could like feed all of their like manuals into an ai and the ai could like independently determine what to do to help close the client that’s literally what we’re building yeah that’s awesome i hope you guys do that i’ll buy it um yeah yeah for sure so really so like they they said it to you like that like like it’s it’s a live call and it’s like transcribing it it’s like hey oh they’re giving this objections.

**00:22:53**  
to say this that that kind of thing is that that’s exactly right yeah um once we’re once where we have a like demo in like a week or so like we can actually show you if you want um but it is for an insurance, you, sales agency, and they’re pretty fucking huge apparently. This guy has written books, and he’s like an eight-figure company, and he has given talks and stuff on how to do insurance sales. So he’s just basically aggregated.

**00:23:24**  
all of his database information and put it into this chatbot and it’s able to help guide people. So they use it for training and also for live calls, yeah. Interesting, that’s so cool. Yeah, I haven’t heard of a lot of people doing this. So I could potentially, I could actually very well use something like that. If I had an autonomous agent that was able to chat with clients and then chat with writers, having that as one angle of it would be extremely useful. And I guess the cool thing about this would be,

**00:23:54**  
if you guys are looking to fine-tune these models too, I do have a lot of people and a lot of, just a lot of real-world, like situations that could get trained on like right away you know yeah um dozens every single day yeah um so yeah it’s it’s like you know there’s um there’s uh another field that i’m somewhat familiar with is it’s like uh how guys run only fans accounts i know this is all the shady businesses in the world just bear with me here um and uh what they’ll do is they’ll hire.

**00:24:29**  
they’re called chatters right and it’s usually just like a basement of dudes in the philippines, and they’re pretending to be the girl they’re chatting with the guy dave is like dying there yeah, Yeah, but I always wonder, how much money are these guys leaving on the table? Because I’m sure they don’t, you’re just training people in third world countries to do this stuff. Those people don’t have full-on sales training. I always thought it would be so cool if you had some type of autonomous chat agent that you could train to do that automatically.

**00:25:06**  
So that would be a really good use case for something like this, honestly. And I actually think I know agencies that might even want to buy that straight away. Oh, shit, yeah. Yeah, I’m down. Yeah, I know people in that world. There’s actually a really big OnlyFans marketing community. It’s all very black hat. It’s usually just people who live in Miami and spend way too much money. But if you could tell them, hey guys, you can replace your chat team with this. There’s actually probably a SaaS there that generates very good MRR.

**00:25:37**  
If that ever be something you guys would be into. Let’s fucking do it, Thomas. I’m down. That’s some synergy. Yeah, Gabe’s really into pretending to be a hot, sexy woman and chat with random strangers on the internet. So it’s right up his wheelhouse. But yeah, it seems like there’s potential here beyond doing work for you. Maybe we can partner up on something. Who knows? We can definitely keep the conversation going.

**00:26:11**  
100%. Yeah, man. I love meeting new people. And any information I could ever share about any of this stuff with you guys, please feel free. So yeah, cool. What do you think our next steps here would be? Yeah, so this project, I got some pretty good information from this call. I want to come up with a list of questions. Based on our call and I’ll send it over and then you can fill it out, And then we can maybe sync up again.

**00:26:45**  
To go over some things and and maybe get access to, your air table account and, Yeah, I will prepare some information we’ll need some uncertainties We still have and then we sync up again but then after that we basically can send you a proposal of a price range of How much it will cost right? So the proposal will be like the solution architecture, The solution timeline the faces that we’re going to implement the deliverables of each success criteria and potential cost range.

**00:27:19**  
And then that way, you know, like how long I might take and what’s the ballpark? And then we can continue from there. What do you what do you think? yeah sounds great um do you guys want me to show you an example of like one of the manuals recipes that i have right now um if it’s associated with this project yeah if you can send them over that’d be great yeah it’s actually literally the manual for this exact position that i’m trying to automate so it has everything in it dude like dude just in that over man that.

**00:27:50**  
sounds so good i’m so hard right now uh since we’re talking about queer sexual things but yeah no no that would be good yeah yeah all right cool cool um yeah i think like just having it all documented like that i’m sure it just makes it so much easier because it even explains like the various situations the person runs into, um yeah cool and then uh regarding um the chatbot that you guys are building is like are you retaining the ip to like that in and of itself and just kind of selling it to the client if you don’t.

**00:28:22**  
mind me asking if it’s the end if it’s nda that’s totally cool too i’m just curious like do you get to keep the underlying architecture so you can put it in the system the full system ip is the clients however his chatbot is overly complex um because he just has a lot of stuff that needs to work out we have we have the knowledge of how to build stuff like that right so i mean they literally cannot take the ip for experience and knowledge so we have that and we.

**00:28:53**  
also have like i said we have our ai workflow and proprietary system that builds software really fast, And we know exactly what needs to be built, right? So we can basically rebuild major components of the system however we want it to be pretty fast, yeah. And Thomas, to be clear, are you talking about the law? Like the text chatbot? Or the live coaching thing?

**00:29:23**  
Oh, yeah, the one regarding insurance sales. Oh, that one. I think that one’s a different story. That one, we, I think, are able to use some code snippets. Like lower-level code snippets. But same story, right? We can build it really, really fast. Yeah, yeah, for relatively cheap. Yeah, that’s super cool. Yeah, I think there’s just a really good market for like a really well-marketed SaaS that essentially does that for different niches, whether it’s, you know, like OnlyFans marketing or like any chat-based sales type stuff.

**00:30:00**  
A lot of companies are leaving a lot of money on the table just because there’s such a knowledge gap with like, even me, if I go like watch all the sales training, I’m just going to print certain stuff and I’m not going to maybe always know the perfect thing to reply to their objections. So it’s just a super cool idea. That’s awesome to hear you guys are doing that. I love that. Yeah, yeah. Just throwing an idea out there. So what we’re thinking of, I mean, we do intend on trying to find other clients for this solution, just to be clear.

**00:30:34**  
But we’re not thinking of making it into a SaaS. Rather, like, I mean, with AI, making development so cheap and so fast. And we believe that this new wave, it’s going to be more about customized software, more than one-fits-all solutions. So I think the model we’re having in mind is we get just really, really building this stuff really, really fast for a really good price, and we just build customized solutions.

**00:31:11**  
for each client, depending on their industry niche. Cool, cool. Well, yeah, that’s super awesome, too. Well, yo, guys, that’s great. So next steps here, I’ll shoot over that SOP to you guys. Maybe I’ll just fire up LinkedIn here and say hello. How’s that sound? That sounds great. We’ll check it out and see if there’s any additional uncertainties, and then send over a question. list and maybe we can get together at the end of the week or early next week um yeah yeah i think.

**00:31:44**  
we’re taking tomorrow off right gabe or yeah i’m taking 31 on first off so yeah probably next week yeah yeah cool good yeah wonderful awesome where are you located thomas i actually i live really far away i live in the country of georgia oh wow oh yeah i live next to russia in iran basically. what about you guys you just get more and more interesting than when we talk huh.

**00:32:15**  
keep some stuff down though but a lot of things came out through this call, i mean i’m in dc i’m in dc yeah okay i mean puerto rico, oh cool are you from there originally yes nice you know in which area
