* Weipeng Zhuo12:36 PM  
* Here.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:37 PM  
* Hello.  
* Sean Galloway12:37 PM  
* Hey buddy, how you doing?  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:37 PM  
* Hello. Sean, can you hear me?  
* Sean Galloway12:37 PM  
* Yes, I can. Can you hear me?  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:37 PM  
* Yes sir, yes sir. Yeah my bad. I'm in Mexico City right now in the middle of a moving. Moving Airbnb. So I can't show you know video.  
* Sean Galloway12:37 PM  
* No, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine. I I was I was uh I didn't want you thinking I forgot about you, I was trying to figure out my login credentials for uh for upwork so I could put it on my phone while I'm driving.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:37 PM  
* Oh, oh, oh gotcha. Yeah, yeah. So we're both moving. Yeah.  
* Sean Galloway12:37 PM  
* So, um, so I I I'm gonna perfect. Perfect. Do you want to do it at a different time?  
* Sean Galloway12:37 PM  
* Okay, let me uh let me convert it over to the phone because you're on my you're on my laptop right now.  
* Sean Galloway12:38 PM  
* All right, 2 seconds.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:38 PM  
* Yes sir. Yes sir.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:39 PM  
* We can also just do this for via phone call if you want.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:39 PM  
* You need to.  
* Sean Galloway12:39 PM  
* What is?  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:39 PM  
* Also, just call if you want it might be easier.  
* Sean Galloway12:39 PM  
* Uh, it's it. Uh, here. Here it goes. I got it.  
* Sean Galloway12:39 PM  
* Um, it's uh I had to wait. I had to sign in and stuff and download the app.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:40 PM  
* While you driving, bro.  
* Sean Galloway12:40 PM  
* Uh, yeah. I know it's bad, bad choices.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:40 PM  
* It's okay. I will report you.  
* Sean Galloway12:40 PM  
* Don't do this at home.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:40 PM  
* Mhm.  
* Sean Galloway12:40 PM  
* All right, cool. I'm joining now.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:40 PM  
* Yes, sir.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:40 PM  
* Yeah, look at it.  
* Sean Galloway12:40 PM  
* All righty.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:40 PM  
* Yeah, so where are you going?  
* Sean Galloway12:40 PM  
* Is that better?  
* Sean Galloway12:40 PM  
* All righty. So, how you doing, buddy?  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:40 PM  
* I'm good. I'm good. We're like changing our Airbnb and I took place. We're in Mexico City right now. This is me and my partner Dave,  
* Sean Galloway12:40 PM  
* How you doing?  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:40 PM  
* My business partner? Yeah. Yeah.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:40 PM  
* Um but yeah. So like um now we just came here like 2 days ago just for a trip. I'm in the US I live in DC.  
* Sean Galloway12:41 PM  
* Is that where you're comfortable? Are you from Mexico City?  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:41 PM  
* Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:41 PM  
* we're just here for a bit, um, and then we're going to Cancun in next week for a conference or talking at an immigration law firm conference, talk about like data kpi and a  
* Sean Galloway12:41 PM  
* Okay.  
* Sean Galloway12:41 PM  
* Okay.  
* Sean Galloway12:41 PM  
* That's awesome.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:41 PM  
* Yes sir. Yes sir.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:41 PM  
* Um, so yeah. Uhuh.  
* Sean Galloway12:41 PM  
* Awesome. So  
* Sean Galloway12:41 PM  
* so uh, you know,  
* Sean Galloway12:41 PM  
* I saw your profile man. I was I was highly impressed. So I was like, I gotta I gotta talk to this guy.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:41 PM  
* Yes, sir.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:41 PM  
* Yes sir. Yes sir, thank you, thank you. I've been I've been around the block. Yeah.  
* Sean Galloway12:41 PM  
* That, that's awesome. So uh, tell me a little bit about yourself.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:41 PM  
* Yeah, so um, I was doing a PhD in chemical engineering at Georgia Tech which is like uh, the number 3 engineering school in the country. Um, and then, uh, and after that decided to go into uh,  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:42 PM  
* Data engineering and data science, and end up meta for a couple years.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:42 PM  
* Um, kind of got bored of it when when AI was popping off, I kind of got bored of it. I wanted to do more like entrepreneurship, um, so ended up doing a lot of like, really that's work out upwork and then start a company.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:42 PM  
* and uh,  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:42 PM  
* hired a couple of Engineers. Um, so doing we're doing like consultancy specializing in like AI development. We developed our own AI system that allows us to build software really fast  
* Sean Galloway12:42 PM  
* Mhm.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:42 PM  
* our, we pass that along to our  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:42 PM  
* Our our clients so we can build stuff really fast and relatively cheap.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:42 PM  
* Um yes sir. Yes sir, yes, sir and that's been doing really well.  
* Sean Galloway12:42 PM  
* That's awesome. So it does the coding for you and all that stuff.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:42 PM  
* Yeah, there's a coding for us. Um, so we're cut down the coding time called  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:42 PM  
* like a fraction, you know. Um, so we can offer like better prices and speed for for  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:42 PM  
* So that's been doing really well actually.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:43 PM  
* Um yeah yeah. So that's pretty much it.  
* Sean Galloway12:43 PM  
* Oh, that's cool.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:43 PM  
* Let's see, so that combined experience from a lot of data, engineering data science, PhD research Academia. Um, we actually just uh published a recent paper with John Hawkins on a vision AI research so that was pretty cool.  
* Sean Galloway12:43 PM  
* Okay. Okay. No, that's awesome, man. That's awesome. And so uh the description of kind of what I posted if you have any questions about it or anything like that.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:43 PM  
* I actually just been traveling, like so much. I haven't got a chance to uh, review.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:43 PM  
* Because again um do you mind just give me a quick synopsis? So like  
* Sean Galloway12:43 PM  
* Mhm.  
* Sean Galloway12:43 PM  
* Yep yep um so so basically uh I own a Restoration company. Um basically we I specialize in housing that catch on fire or that fluid um and you know I've uh you know I've I've been in the AI space since uh I want to say like like right after Co um so like 2020\. Um you know it kind of came mainstream over the last like what 3 years um  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:44 PM  
* Mhm.  
* Sean Galloway12:44 PM  
* My general contracting business I'm like oh okay like G is you know it's here. If you're not using technology you're gonna be the 1 that works for someone who uses technology and um you know I I want I mean I mean I was like a tech a tech guy that always wanted to make sure that not a tech guy but I was always 1 of those guys that wanted to use technology to make my job easier and now that AI is more. So here on the on the Battlefront I want to utilize that in the restoration space to make my job easier and other restoration guys jobs easier and in the in the same industry. Um so 1 of the things that I do that is kind of cumbersome and kind of a pain in the ass is I have to deal with insurance companies and I don't want to pay anything. And so 1 of the things that I have to do continuously is have great documentation and so, basically great documentation, you know, it's not it, it great documentation is in the eye of the beholder.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:44 PM  
* Yes, sir.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:44 PM  
* Mhm.  
* Sean Galloway12:45 PM  
* Right? So if you have a technician, that doesn't know what the heck to take a picture of, he's gonna take a picture of whatever he thinks he needs to take a picture of. And then you have the office at the office staff, the office. They know what they want. I have pictures of, but it's kind of like a gray line to relay that to a technician. That really isn't is, he's only there to dry the building out. He's not there to collect payments to argue with insurance companies to argue with adjusters. He doesn't know what he's supposed to get. So basically,  
* Sean Galloway12:45 PM  
* Uh, I wanted to come up with a software that basically teaches, it's basically like a crescent, a smart CRM that basically would tell the technician, like, hey, it would ask the technician a couple questions as to what he needs at on that job site. And what basically, uh,  
* Sean Galloway12:46 PM  
* Scan the room not using lidar, but they have other other things like cubic Costa that we can use that are a little bit better quality than lidar. Um,  
* Sean Galloway12:46 PM  
* Any other variations of that, um, and basically utilize that to see what's going on with that job and what needs to happen on that job, those videos and the pictures that the technicians would take would then be transcribed and uploaded into the software and basically, a estimate will be generated from that. Um, the estimate would be, uh, a lot more accurate to have. The AI, do it because, you know, obviously a human have, we have errors and what we do. But, you know, having that knowledge base of the IICRC standard uh, integrated into it, plus with real job, experience and data, getting fed to, it would make that AI smarter for smarter. Suggestions smarter updates, smarter recommendations and reasonings behind those estimate, uh, line items. Uh, from  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:47 PM  
* Mhm.  
* Sean Galloway12:47 PM  
* And uh yeah, thanks pretty much it. Thank you.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:47 PM  
* Yes sir. Yes sir.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:47 PM  
* I love that you're very tech tech forward and Tech Enthusiast and that's like the biggest differentiator between people who succeed if you fall behind the next decade, you know what I'm saying? So  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:47 PM  
* I can already see that where where you're leading to success. Um,  
* Sean Galloway12:47 PM  
* Definitely.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:47 PM  
* second thing I want to say is we do we we have several uh uh real estate and construction clients already. Um so a couple your project is uh really similar to some that we built already like um,  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:48 PM  
* We have 1 company that is also fired and like Flood Restoration company. Um but we built like a lead generation pipeline for them.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:48 PM  
* The most the most similar stuff to your stuff. Is that we actually building something for this like Saudi Arabia company.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:48 PM  
* Um, where we're using video, we're ingesting video because they have a lot of construction projects. So, we're ingesting video that their technicians take to monitor the progression of the construction, right? So, so, basically, a technician goes in. They do they just do like a video taking.  
* Sean Galloway12:48 PM  
* Okay.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:48 PM  
* um and then it will be able to to document uh what percentage of uh  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:48 PM  
* Finish is for each aspect of the of the construction for that place.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:48 PM  
* um,  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:48 PM  
* Yeah. And then we will ingest like uh some files to build the blueprint of the  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:48 PM  
* Project. So then people know we the AI knows where they should walk towards and where they need more information. And um, how many rooms there are what's the electric systems, which system Etc.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:49 PM  
* So we're already building like a video analysis project.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:49 PM  
* so it's like, oh well within our our  
* Sean Galloway12:49 PM  
* Mhm.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:49 PM  
* Um, I think your project makes a lot of sense. So basically, uh,  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:49 PM  
* My understanding is that you have you know, technician going to do the walk through.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:49 PM  
* And it's going to be used. It's we're going to use the video of that walk through in conjunction with some existing knowledge base of you usually do projects, um and the usual uh call spaces materials for certain type of projects so that you can seek and develop a, uh, a cost estimate, uh, based on how you usually do things. The historical prices that you have for similar, uh, projects and based on the videos,  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:49 PM  
* um, for that new project, right?  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:49 PM  
* Yeah. Yeah. That's completely doable for sure.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:49 PM  
* We can even we're so showers so f\*\*\*\*\*\* good at building software. Like I can send you a proof of concept. If you send me a video or 2, like I can show you a proof of concept of what we, what might be leaning towards. What you're what you're thinking.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:50 PM  
* like, in a week in a week like before you even pay us  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:50 PM  
* You know what I'm saying, bro, bro, I'm telling you, but, but yeah, no, no, we can, we can, we can do that. Um, but again, I think I have sufficient information from this meeting. This meeting is recorded, so let me use a transcript, um, to basically build a super early like proof of concept prototype for you. So if you just send me a video of what of something that you want to analyze, right? Um,  
* Sean Galloway12:50 PM  
* Okay.  
* Sean Galloway12:50 PM  
* That confident.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:50 PM  
* And then we schedule a meeting in a week or or even less maybe like after uh Thanksgiving like Monday or something, right. Then I'll just show you what we have.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:50 PM  
* If you like it, you know, so that, you know, that we're not bullshiting on the fact that we can build good stuff fast we can move forward and then I'll coach you on the prices and the prices will be really reasonable.  
* Sean Galloway12:51 PM  
* Mhm.  
* Sean Galloway12:51 PM  
* So on, uh, on. So on timeline wise for something like this. So I've been at first, I was going to use a local a local developer man and uh you know, normally I would deal with Filipinos. I work with a lot of Filipinos. Um, you know, and you know I I had them trying to build it out and it was just kind of more so a burden and then I tried to developer that was local to where I'm at and Cincinnati number Cincinnati and uh you know, they they kind of more so Outsource a lot of their stuff and they kind of more. So uh they have the owner who micromanages everything and he's slow. So that makes everyone else slow and it just wasn't a great combination. So they kind of had me behind on what our what, our where, like where I wanted to be on this, on timeline wise, what would something like this take, take for you guys to build from start to finish.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:51 PM  
* Mhm.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:51 PM  
* Mhm.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:51 PM  
* Mhm.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:51 PM  
* Where where you at? Okay.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:52 PM  
* Yeah.  
* Sean Galloway12:52 PM  
* Just and I'll promise I wouldn't hold this over your head. I promise I wouldn't but I just kind of like, ballpark wise  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:52 PM  
* um,  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:52 PM  
* uh, depending based on depend on exactly this, like, from from, from what we talked about, it sounds like we could get somebody built for you within like 2 weeks after you, we sign the contract.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:52 PM  
* Like I said, like I I will build like a a bulk of it.  
* Sean Galloway12:52 PM  
* Some guy.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:52 PM  
* like 50% of it just for the approval concept by next week for, I'll show you that, you know, um,  
* Sean Galloway12:52 PM  
* M.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:52 PM  
* And we'll get some more specifics of what we really want.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:52 PM  
* And then we'll we'll try to aim to get another prototype of it built.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:53 PM  
* Uh, start to finish from you signing a contract. Being finished 2 week up to 3 weeks, Max.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:53 PM  
* Sound.  
* Sean Galloway12:53 PM  
* Okay. Now that sounds awesome. Uh so basically this will kind of be our should be like the first phase of it. Uh so I mean I can tell you the whole entire project. If you want me to that way, it says it's recorded or I can just kind of more some say, the first part of it, it's up to you on how you would want it to that. But uh, yeah. I mean, I kind of I yes.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:53 PM  
* Yeah. Yeah.  
* Sean Galloway12:54 PM  
* The estimating that helps the, I have that helps the estimator out, the explaining of line items that helps the accounts receivable Personnel. Right. So now I'm using technology in all aspects. Uh, in that instance, uh, to basically make technology, I mean, make make what we do a lot easier. The other part that I wanted to do is make accounts receivable a lot easier and basically use the IICRC standard to argue with insurance.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:54 PM  
* Want to.  
* Sean Galloway12:54 PM  
* Yep, the and my back now.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:54 PM  
* uh, uh,  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:54 PM  
* Yeah. Yeah, you're back. Now do you mind repeating? Like you're you're doing better. Do you mind repeating the last like minute? I'll talk you.  
* Sean Galloway12:54 PM  
* Am I still breaking up?  
* Sean Galloway12:54 PM  
* Yeah. Okay.  
* Sean Galloway12:55 PM  
* Yep. Yep, yep. So yeah, I was gonna call it. I came in. So basically, um, um, like the, the the scanning, the scanning aspect of it, that helps the technician get better, uh, a better game plan of what to do in the field. You know, the estimate writing that helps the estimator become, uh, more efficient, estimator, uh, the, uh, accounts receivable, you know, on, uh, the explanations as to why we chose these line items for this specific, uh, tasks, that helps the accounts receivable department. But I also wanted to make the accounts receivable Department, um, like the tech the process, uh, I'm sorry. Not the process. The the, uh, the features in the software better for the accounts receivable Department, by arguing with the insurance, adjusters on the accounts receivable behalf by email. So basically like a, a sequence of a follow-ups. Uh, basically emails of like, hey, you know, following up on this email.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:55 PM  
* Mhm.  
* Sean Galloway12:56 PM  
* Hey, following up on this email. Hey, follow up on on this email explanation as to why certain things were done, you know. Um, basically, you know, the lower end part of the software development part, I keep getting calls. Can you hear me now?  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:56 PM  
* Mhm.  
* Sean Galloway12:56 PM  
* Okay, yep. Yep.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:56 PM  
* Uh, hello.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:56 PM  
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You said, lower end of the cost development. Yeah, no that's cool. Because another I'll tell you about another project,  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:56 PM  
* There's so much like, uh, synergies. Uh, we're building this system for credit report.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:56 PM  
* Where some like someone can uh, log in uh, put their credit report in there. And then the AI will automatically send dispute letters.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:56 PM  
* Automatically draft and send dispute letters for various like highly disputable items within the credit report. Right? So we built we built systems before where, where, like all AI automatically Drafting and Performing disputes and negotiations.  
* Sean Galloway12:56 PM  
* Mhm.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:56 PM  
* Uh, based on a set of input data.  
* Sean Galloway12:57 PM  
* You know, the it's it's funny you say that because back in 2021 that was my first uh software that I actually had get built out with AI. So I actually I I actually had a white label of a credit repair software that did that. Yeah. Yep. Yep. And yeah, so that's after that I fell in love with AI because I used to do credit repair on the side and uh some for some clients it would take like a day for some clients. It would take a couple hours man. We I would put someone's credit report in there and it would be literally be done in 15 seconds like so yeah I have so uh it's it's it's awesome that you said that. Okay, so you have experience with that too. So yeah I'm obviously I'm not I'm not dibbling and dabbling into that industry as much as I used to but uh not that s\*\*\* was awesome when I used to do it.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:57 PM  
* Lawyer.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:57 PM  
* Oh snap.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:57 PM  
* oh,  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:57 PM  
* Oh, that's why.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:57 PM  
* Yes, sir.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:57 PM  
* Nice. Nice, nice. I love it, man. Yo, we're gonna have some fun, uh, Sean.  
* Sean Galloway12:57 PM  
* Yeah, let's do it. Let's do it. And I'm always, I'm always down for Innovation and, and bettering wherever industry I'm in. So, uh, you know, like I said I hate doing s\*\*\* the hard way. Especially when I know it's tools and people out there that can help me build the tools and the flows and the capabilities to get everything done easier. So yeah, I'm um, yeah, I'm game. I've interviewed a couple developers. I actually like you, I like your personality. So, uh uh, yeah, I will, I will, I would love to, I would love to see how this concept goes and then um, you know, kind of more so see on, um, and we we be a good fit. Um, now I won't hold you to this. I promise you, I won't but like just based off of the I promise you I I I won't do. I won't hold you to anything until everything is kind of like broken down and you can kind of agree to certain things. So, but um, but basically like just based off of your based off of what I kind of said over the phone and kind of how you envision the flows to go and everything, uh, price-wise bought like and I and I will and I got  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:57 PM  
* Um,  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:58 PM  
* Sir. Yes sir. I like you too.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:58 PM  
* Huh.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:58 PM  
* Yes sir. Yes sir.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:59 PM  
* 4 for your first initial scope.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:59 PM  
* We might be able to get it done around 4 to 6 k.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:59 PM  
* Depending on the complexity of it, we might be able to get it done, 426 k.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:59 PM  
* Um, I will again, I will. So, it depends on what if it's if it's a  
* Sean Galloway12:59 PM  
* Okay.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:59 PM  
* A couple of things. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So so it depends on what what? What feature we're talking about. The 1 feature that we talked about, might be difficult, is AI telling live AI feedback telling people where they need to go.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:59 PM  
* That might add that might actually double the price, right? So but if not if we just have someone walk through record a video, send a video over to the app that's that's that's relatively cake. We can probably get for for less than 5K.  
* Sean Galloway12:59 PM  
* Yes, sir.  
* Weipeng Zhuo12:59 PM  
* um, so  
* Sean Galloway12:59 PM  
* Mhm.  
* Sean Galloway1:00 PM  
* okay, so basically the recorded video and then have the AI more, so  
* Weipeng Zhuo1:00 PM  
* Yeah, yeah. So like post hoc analysis, right after the video is reported, you send it in AI analyze it. I think we could get that done. Let's say between 3 to 6 K, uh, just to widen the range of it. Yeah.  
* Sean Galloway1:00 PM  
* Oh, okay.  
* Weipeng Zhuo1:00 PM  
* My my my guy we're like we're building.  
* Weipeng Zhuo1:00 PM  
* Like first world top.  
* Weipeng Zhuo1:00 PM  
* Softwares at you know f\*\*\*\*\*\* PhD meta experience people quality at like third world Philippines rate. You know what I'm saying? So like  
* Sean Galloway1:00 PM  
* I know.  
* Weipeng Zhuo1:00 PM  
* but um,
