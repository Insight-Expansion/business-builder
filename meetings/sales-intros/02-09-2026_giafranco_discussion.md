experts. So I think this is more fundamental than marketing, but it's kind of like marketing the way to sell it to lawyers. They need to do that. They don't know how to do it. Somebody needs to do it for them. And you can tell them how easy it needs to do that. I still think they're not going to do it. I agree with you with everything that you're saying, and I'm excited about that too. But I still don't think they're going to do it. Yeah, I agree. I agree. So we had 20 people sign up on our register. Five people showed up and all five of them are non-lawyers. They are office managers, admin managers. That's great. But these are law firms that are going to succeed because they're people doing stuff like that. Exactly. But you see the lawyers, they don't show up. They don't have to. Because their time is more valuable. They're completely wrong. And they're afraid of the technology. They're like, I don't know. But they don't need to be expert in technology because I've been studying, since now implementing AI in my firms. But before doing that, I wanted to, you know, I've been studying how corporate is doing that for a while now, in programs and stuff like that. I don't need to be an expert, but I need to understand it, you know? And lawyers just put their head in the sand, like, you know, ostriches and say, you know, somebody's gonna do it or I don't need it. So we are a tough market. And that's why, you know, like, I think that's another reason why this, this happened with the stock market, because it kind of shows that industry is so resistant with change, how quickly it can go down, you know, and also like all these legal tech companies. Today I would invest a dollar on a legal tech product because tomorrow it may be obsolete. And I think what I would do is exactly what you guys are doing. Upskilling, learning, implementing. And I think that in itself is a product that you can offer. You know what I mean? I don't know what to call it, implementers, I guess. Because, but I don't know if I'm wrong, you know, from the marketing perspective, because, you know, traditional model to sell to offers, hey, get into one to three years contract, we lock you in, like, you know, the traditional. It made sense before because technology didn't change that much. But today, at least if you understand how AI is, I wouldn't say I wouldn't do anything more than one to one, maybe three months, it would be my maximum term, you know? This thing changes too fast. yeah and so i i think what you guys are doing is exactly the gap in the market right now uh i would so you say you're just doing linkedin linkedin linkedin is good because you're talking to people who are already into that those are the people who go on linkedin you know what i mean um to reach the other ones Like for instance, in our program now, we're doing three Q&A sessions. Monday, social media. Wednesday, intake. And Thursday, we're doing AI. And the level is very basic, guys. They don't even know what a prompt is, some of them. And I tell you, we have to teach them what a prompt is. okay a prompt the way you talk to another land guys so like you see like it's um tell me exactly what to write jeff that's i don't know like it's it's very very low you know yeah but these are people willing to put themselves out there and learn but they don't even breathe this so like because you know with the they don't and lawyers know nothing and they're afraid you know so but fear it's always a good point to sell because like if i was running a company like yours i would um present myself as the person or the company who eases their fears you know who guides them through through the change and the fears you know because two things usually sell we learn over five six years of doing marketing it's aspiration hope transformation sells as much or maybe a little less than fear those are the two strongest emotions that sell you know and the AI generates fear like few other things. Yeah, so because I think you're like I see I mean you your eyes light up when you talk about it and I can feel the excitement here you know so same but then you're just talking to these people who are excited about it, you know what I mean? whereas the messaging is going to reach the real meat and money is people were afraid and you saw them how easy it is and how safe safe because safety is another thing that we freak out hey this is not safe this is safer the problem is where you use email now you know but Okay, what are you going to say something? What, what, what? Like, I feel like an issue with cloud, co-work, and all this AI stuff is like, I think that to really get the most value out of it, like, it's so open, you spoke about this way earlier, like, it's so open-ended in what it can do. I think it requires, like, a little bit of, like, creativity and, like, just, like, just Just being like entrepreneurial in the sense, like just making up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. I think that's a big issue with adoption. And they are not like that. You know, they're like, so the other day, we did kind of like what you did in the session and we showed them how to do. So how to create an email assistant, like call, and then how to create a logo and then how to create a link in bio, because you can just create. a mini web page, you know? And they were all so excited, they couldn't believe you could do that. Like, you know, the growing fruit is so low, you know? And I think what you're doing is genius. I mean, are you collecting their emails? - Yeah, yeah, so, yes. - How are you remarketing them? - We have a GoHighLevel, which is your page. - Okay. We send that over via automated Drebify DMs. - Okay. - We don't post on our LinkedIn as much, I think, if we need to do more of that marketing. - I see you guys. I've seen it more frequently recently. - But not about the webinars we're doing, right? - Yeah. - I think we should post-- - No, I see you posting about AI in general and comment. Not about the webinars. - Right, right, right. And this is-- - Are you doing any ads? - We're not doing ads right now. be a good thing. Spend $5-10, don't spend too much on us just to see what comes in, warm up the engine. Yeah, that's a good call, good experimentation. But here's the other part of it that I haven't touched on. We're trying to funnel, the CTA in the webinar is joining our school community. So creating a school community. We call it a law firm AI lab or AI law firm lab. I love it. Where people join for the community aspect of it but also we have exclusive advanced webinars for connecting your AI reception to calendar and CRM, etc. And do you have different tiers? Free, paying, or doing? Right now we're just trying to get more users. We only have one more. Now you want to get more users. Okay. And what's the angle? To sell them them for you or to sell them projects? Two things. One is eventually we want to be a paid thing. Of course. Right. So we have some sort of passive income. Secondly is lead generation or having people be familiar with our product and what we're capable of. So you want to use that to build trust. Build trust. Exactly. Build trust and then start custom projects. We were even thinking about creating custom plugins for various workflows within an immigration law firm and then sell them. Made for like $1,000 cheap, $1,000 one-time thing. And then pay by the hour for customization of the basic plugin for your firm. So we're thinking about multiple tiers, selling base packages, and then basically eventually leading to some sort of custom workforce. Yeah, and then also using that to basically generate ideas on what they need. Ask them what their pain points are. It's a community to outsource marketing research. I think it's great. Let me tell you my experience with this. So we are selling them something similar. It's a school community where we teach them how to do social media marketing so they can do what we do. And we also did that in the past when we were selling to B2C to our clients, how to work in the U.S., for instance, because those videos got 10, 20 million views. But, so we were selling them how to work in the U.S., okay? So that's how to find a job, how to find a sponsorship, like a course. And then what you do in the community, I think it's great, But to make real money, you need to be careful about not selling them work or effort. So we are seeing, you know, like we sell programs and we teach them what to do, but you know what they want? They want the video recording for them and post it and done and everything. So like they don't record themselves as much. So they want the work done for them. You know what I mean? That's where the money is. And I think it's great though that you create that, to put your name out there. But the quicker you can take them to do something for them, the quicker you're going to start creating money for you. I don't know if you can be-- usually it's part of a one-off thing, but maybe, and I don't know if you guys are looking to do something like that, some sort of subscription model where you are like their, I don't know if consultant is the right word, but they have access to you for a certain amount of time. The problem with that is not they have access to you for a certain amount of time. So you need to price it at a price that makes sense for you to have a return on investment. Or you can hire people to do it for you. You know what I mean? like that can be the people who do the office hours or they help them through something. Because for now, they don't know what they don't know, which is what you're trying to break the gap between the ignorance about AI and to show them how easy it is to do. But what we found over the years is that education doesn't sell as much as transformation. When you need to explain to them that they have a problem and they know why like the life cycle, if there is one at all, it's too long. But you need to show them I can fix this for you, you know? So use that more like to show them what they can do and then go straight, you know, we're here to help you with that or we offer this and that, you know what I mean? It doesn't need to be salesy necessarily because I think you're using the right strategy to give value before asking for something, which is what we do as well. and I think it's still the best strategy. But nowadays, they're in desperate need of guidance. And I think that a lot of money now, it's really in this guidance, you know what I mean? Which is not necessarily what you want to do long term, because I think you guys probably want to create product software or something like that, which makes a lot of sense, because it's more scalable, it doesn't require you you know, many face hours and stuff like that. But I really think that short term, short to medium term, consultancy is the way to get there. Does it make sense what I'm trying to say? - Yeah. So like teaching them or even firms like, hey, that's what you need for AI, oh, that's how AI works. So that's how you can implement it, you know? And then on top of that, you can upsell them for the stuff that you can do for them. I think nowadays that's what they need because they are afraid. They tell us that they're afraid. Yeah. We are afraid as a profession. I should put myself in there. I'm not afraid, but we are afraid. And I'm afraid too. Like things are moving so fast, and we're like at the cutting edge, and things are-- Yeah, like we are all a bit afraid, I think, in a certain point. But it's not the fear that they have. They're afraid because they don't know what this is. We don't really know what this is, but I think, you know, if you know a little more, you're not as afraid or maybe you're more afraid, I don't know. But yeah, so I think short term it's there because building software now, like, it changes too fast. It's like what you were saying, what was everyone doing 2025, 2024? Everybody was doing AI agents. They're still doing that. Everybody's selling AI agents. You just said it. In one hour webinar, you create it for them for free. You know what I mean? Yeah. And that today is the worst it's ever going to be, because tomorrow it's really going to be better. Yeah. And it's going to be easier. So I think the real money is in tech for now. Sorry, legal tech. And the problem that everyone has is understanding this team and getting trusted people to guide them through it. Yeah. Yeah. Go again. I want to, yeah, I think it's really interesting what you're saying that, yeah, like they care more about transformation rather than education and also what they need is guidance. going deeper into that two things like one is like exactly guidance on what like what was truly on top of mind for these people and number two is like since you have experience with a school community and whatnot do you think they actually care about like education and now they'll pay a good amount for a subscription of like for education or do you think so what you sell them what they want, their transformation. But what they need is education. You know what I mean? But if you try to sell them what they need, you're not gonna sell them. It's like with us, you know, I mean, we sell some, you know, what they need for social media is understanding how it works, sitting down and doing it. But what they want is that somebody is doing it for them in two hours. But we give them both what they need, like understanding it, and then we can do that. So they definitely need that. Some people will pay for that. Most people won't give unless-- I don't know if you go by Gabe. Unless they feel that you're giving them something tangible. And what's top of mind for them is-- I think it's still in the abstract for many of them. You know, so they hear other people who are using that and say, well, they're using AI, but what is it? What does it do? And so having a safe space for them, for instance, we tell them, look, there are no damn questions here. And if there are, we're not going to tell you because they need to feel free to ask things that are very basic, you know. So if you can offer the kind of safe space and then you can have a free tier, like you can do it as a free kind of thing and say you want to have a few good courses, you know, like I think, but don't invest too much time on that because just make MVP courses that are good. You can actually use the webinars, record them and show them to them. You can repackage them, you know, in little classes, you know, cut them. So it looks like, I mean, it's more like the way it looks rather than, you know, the wrapping rather than, because the content sure it could, you know, and so you deliver it to them in that way. And then you can say, and then once I see, oh, these guys are actually teaching me something, they don't ask me for anything else, have the clearly available upgrade options in there, you know. And it can start with a consultation. It can be free or it can be paid up to you. If you do a free one, do a short one, like a 15 minutes one, you know, just to get to know them and see what are their pain points. And then I would try, you know, like, for instance, now we are still in study mode refining the offer and everything because we talk to them and we see what their objections are, both in terms of price and deliverables and actually what they want to overcome. So you need to talk to them. Okay? I don't know. How many firms have you guys talked to so far? A dozen or so so far, yeah. Okay. You need more. You need 50 to 100 at least, you know, to have a better. And, like, get FaceTime with them. Get FaceTime. Offer it for free. Like, offer it as a strategy session to, I don't know, implement AI or whatever you want to call it, you know? or remove AI or blocks or unleash AI. I don't know what you want to call it. You know, call it different ways. And so you can actually see their pain points. And also, who are you catering to? Are you catering to small firm owners, medium size, any size, or you don't care? - Small to medium, yeah. - Small to medium, okay. Small to medium, there are some areas that are like more PI are more willing to spend because they think more like business people. The other ones are immigration now, be careful because a bunch of people are leaving the field because it's under attack. They don't have much money. So they're looking more for marketing rather than refining processes, if anything. That's what we are hearing from them. Yeah. When are they leaving the field, where are they going? No idea. That's a great question. Some of them are trying to go into personal injury. Others are, because they think it's easy, but it's not. it's not like it's not hard as a job necessarily just takes a year to start getting money because you need to get a settlement so try to get more face time with the firm guys yeah it's like you you definitely have the know-how you already build software so that's great you know you work with r&d looks like that's a big firm so like you know the complexity of the process and you have a lot in terms of experience to share with them. And also you are on top of all the changes daily, you know, of what's going on. But if you care to lawyers, you need to speak like lawyers in the sense, internalize their pain and like you need to become the avatar a little bit and talk to them, you know, the way that mirror, mirror whatever they're feeling and stuff like that. And the only way is talking to them more. Right. Jeff, how might we be able to work together? I think there's a lot of synergy here. Like, I'm thinking maybe like we can hop on to one of your, what do you call it, office hour or like live webinars? And we can do one of the things we're thinking about like how do you use code work? You know? So I tell you, now we are cooperating with a company called Logical that does something similar to you and they are the ones who are taking care of that. But I want to introduce you guys to them because I think you guys have a lot of overlapping things. And the engineer is also from Puerto Rico. Oh, really? Yeah, he's an example engineer. And so I think it'd be good for you guys to be. So I'll try to get a call if you guys are interested. They always are interested in talking to people and I think you guys are gonna get along really well. Even if you are competitors, but you know, I think that to be honest with you, there's even a space for everyone in this field right now. You just focus on your product and do the best that you can. I think, you know, we can probably do a guest session, I think we can totally do that. I think it would be very beneficial for the firm. So for now, we just had two sessions and that's why I'm telling you, we're still learning the level of basic or advanced. And we have people who are advanced, that they use a lot of automations, but we have most of them are on the lower end. So once I think I get a better idea, I'll definitely tell you, hey man, this is what they can benefit from. and we can do a join guest session, definitely. But in the meantime, if you're interested, I'll introduce to JJ and AK. I think you guys will get along really well. - That'd be great, that'd be great. Would it help if we sent you a little like white paper or something about our ideas for POP webinars? - Definitely, go for it. - And what we can do during those webinars. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And I can give you, I can give you my input if you want. I mean a bunch of lawyers group that talk about this stuff a lot. So, and they see what the polls is. And there are lawyers who are kind of like me, they're more on top of this every day and others were like, "What is Claude co-work?" I don't know. Or what is Claude? Just a couple of years, they had to explain it to them. So, but it's a great time to do what you guys are doing. And I think you guys are testing for great things because your mind is in the right place. And there is going to be so much disruption in the legal industry. It's not even funny. Funny, guys. I don't think they see what's coming. And the boomers are going to retire more likely than not. So they're going to be fine, you know, because it's going to be too much adapting for them. Yeah, it's a lot. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Send it over and I'll make the intro. And you usually have a call, but I'll let you know. Maybe you can join our call. I think you guys can learn a lot from each other. Great. Yeah. I love that. Yeah. Awesome. If you don't mind, Gianfranco, I mean, it seems like you have a ton of experience in here. So I really want to make the most out of this. So we have a lawyer friend. Yeah. he's more like into business law like they have like this thing called alien network it's like a network like a worldwide network of law firms and what not but they're more like into business law how do you see that landscape like do you think it's more receptive to this kind of stuff like do they have more money like what's your take on that I'll send you the website in our chat cool If they're doing corporate, they have different type of clients, so they're doing probably most B2B. I think they can have more money depending on the firm. The needs I think would be similar, but probably they need more like contract review and stuff like that. It's more transaction, you know, unless they do more litigation. I like that's like a whole network of community network of a ton of lawyers all across the world yeah this corporate law yeah that's cool there's some I stay planning to I think I think overall Yes, they have more money, but they have a different kind of practice. Usually it's more predictable the kind of income they may have, you know, rather than winning a case for personal injury and stuff like that. Because personal injury, they spend more because it's more like the more money I put into that, the more money I'm going to make. And the faster I am, the more money I'm going to make. So that's why they are the ones usually that are more willing and quick to adopt technology. So if I have to start from a practice area of the firms that are more likely to spend, 100% personal injury or mass stores or something like that, because there's so much more money and it's more like, because it's kind of like a gamble, for lack of a better word, because you don't know how much money you're going to make. You can kind of like guesstimate. But there is more risk taking in the mindset. And they're way more willing to spend money on marketing technology and other things. How might we be able to break into the PI? We really haven't thought about that much yet. We've heard a lot about PI firms that we should get into, but we haven't thought about how to break into it. Is that the PI are the lowest hanging fruit because they think more like business people or the lawyers? So usually the quickest way, but I don't know how saturated it is, but what they care the most about is intake speed. And you guys already need a lot of work in intake. You have a fully built product. So I think, for instance, what you built could definitely work for AI, for PI, sorry. Just try to cater to them. For instance, if you do ads, you do messaging or stuff like that, marketing. PI lawyers, stuff like that. Whatever you do in ads, address at the outset who you're talking to. If you see ads, if you notice, they say personal injury lawyers or lawyers or law firm owners, stuff like that. So talk to either a certain niche or the decision makers. Don't talk to lawyers in general because they don't spend that much. You know what I mean? Up to either law firm owners or a special niche. And so speed is the number one. Like over 60% of people hire the first firm they talk to. And in PI, it's critical. Like the cost per acquisition per client is going through the roof with ads and everything. AI, every second matters, you know? And like you guys already have a sort of like omni-channel solution because they market everywhere. That's also, you can definitely use that what you already built with the volume that you built and try to target them. Try to get calls to them in any way possible. Continue LinkedIn. There are the most step forward, you know, are on LinkedIn. So comment, engage, the webinars are good, try to get them in the school community. But in the school community, again, I think it's great, but it's going to attract only people who like the effort part a little bit because it's fun for them. You won't catch everyone, you know? So like your marketing strategy needs to be all encompassing, if that makes sense. But, you know, for highest return on investment, short term, it's PI, it's oversaturated, but that's the market. And those are the ones we're going to spend the most. Business estate planning, yeah, they can spend, but I don't know. I think they're more conservative in the way they approach this. Gotcha. That's great feedback. Thank you. Yeah. and you don't need a lot of them. Try to get a couple of them. Try to see how it goes. But try to get as much face time as you can. You need to enter into the psyche of the lawyers. You need to understand what they think, what keeps them up at night. And then that's what you sell. And then you give them what they need. Those are two different things. It took us a long time to understand it. Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm going to-- Yeah, we have this being transcribed. I'm thinking I'm going to read over this transcript and lumen it on something. Some good golden nuggets from you, Jeff. So I appreciate it. Yeah, absolutely. Pleasure, guys. So let's stay in touch. Please send me the white paper. I appreciate it. And I'll give you some help. Yeah, yeah. And then let's see if we can link up with your tech partners. Yeah. I think they are so young, very enthusiastic. They have a very similar energy. They are also very curious. So, you know, I think it's always good to meet people. Yeah, yeah. You think it's okay if we book a repeat this meeting every month for a quick 20 minute check-in or something? Yeah, sounds good. Yeah, yeah. Alright, Jeff. I'm there this time, it's usually good. Okay, well, I'll make this repeated every month for 20 minutes. Just a quick second. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, we'll tell you how our webinars and schools are doing and what are some ideas that's like striking the chord. Yeah, and give it a try, you know, try it for a bit, but be ruthless with your time. Meaning if something doesn't work, don't feel bad, move on. Okay. It's all about trying, guys. Okay? I feel like we're trying so many things. No, it's okay, man. We explored social media in September 2020. It took us three years to find the right formula. I mean, we survived, we had money. But to make a lot of money, we found the right offer. August 2023. Awesome. It takes time, guys. Most firms don't fail. Most companies don't fail because they're not good at what they do. It's just because you need to find the right offer. It's all about that. Yeah. All right. All right. All right. Awesome. It's really helpful. Thank you. You're being very generous with your time. Thank you. My pleasure. I can talk about this all day. Thank you, guys. Bye. Bye-bye.
