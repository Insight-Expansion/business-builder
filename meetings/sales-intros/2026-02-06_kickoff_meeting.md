**Robertas's capacity (00:04:33):**
> "We have at the moment when talking about your artificial intelligence AI products, we have on the first hand on the first brief look we have hundreds of potential leads, potential customers to introduce to you." — Robertas, lines 72-74

That's very good. That's very risk-free. Everybody likes it." — Robertas, lines 102-106

**Wei's explanation:**
