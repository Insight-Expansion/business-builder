### 00:02:29

   
**Robertas V.P.:** So,  
**Gabriel Perez:** good.  
**Robertas V.P.:** we we've been speaking with with Ven uh week ago and uh we can  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** Mhm.  
**Robertas V.P.:** little bit speak with Gabby now to introduce each other.  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** Yes. Yes. Gabe is my um co-founder um CTO. Uh we went to grad school together at Georgia Tech and uh he's been an entrepreneur for over a decade. Um he's uh built he's helped built some startups um tech system and got acquired and he's also um built his own SAS and got acquired and um he's got some experience there. Uh but insanely brilliant guy.  
**Robertas V.P.:** Good.  
**Gabriel Perez:** Thanks  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** Yeah.  
**Robertas V.P.:** I am not so good in in artificial intelligence but I am good in fintech and I have many years  
**Gabriel Perez:** for  
**Robertas V.P.:** experience since 1991 approximately about more than three decades and I doing business in highest possible level standards banking banking standards we we are doing many years successfully uh different financing investment and different uh projects from medium to high uh big size.  
   
 

### 00:03:41

   
**Robertas V.P.:** So it is the we guarantee the collaboration with you in very good uh good quality and good standards but I  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, we we we trust you. Uh uh we're very excited  
**Robertas V.P.:** I don't see now they I don't see you I just see the the the something like uh  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** about  
**Robertas V.P.:** purple screen on yours do you now it's okay now it's  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** Oh, yeah. Sorry, I went to uh microwave my oatmeal.  
**Robertas V.P.:** okay yeah we can switch off cameras if you like it's no problem yeah some because  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** Um  
**Robertas V.P.:** sometimes it is taking too much data. So sometimes it's better only voice.  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** Right, right,  
**Robertas V.P.:** So that's it.  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** right.  
**Robertas V.P.:** And and we have at the moment when talking about your artificial intelligence AI products,  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** Um,  
**Robertas V.P.:** we have uh uh on the first hand on the first brief look we have hundreds of potential leads, potential customers to introduce to you.  
   
 

### 00:04:33

   
**Robertas V.P.:** uh but in reality we have maybe thousands and that's the we the only one answer uh not see in it's quite simple of course it's not necessary to answer but just approximately if I ask uh how much uh new potential leads which we pre-select we pre-seelelect professionally how much we can introduce during one week maximum  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** I mean, it depends on the conversion rate. Uh, if it's pretty high conversion, you know, uh, we can probably take on another handful of projects, like one project a week, right, Gabe? So,  
**Robertas V.P.:** Good.  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** Mhm.  
**Robertas V.P.:** Yeah,  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** So,  
**Gabriel Perez:** Yeah.  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** so a week, I don't know. Let's say conversions what like 20%.  
**Robertas V.P.:** because  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** So we can do like a five intro a week if you like or five five meetings a week  
**Robertas V.P.:** yeah that's just just to understand because we can you know we can switch we can we can uh manage how  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** right  
**Robertas V.P.:** much to to introduce them because uh for my opinion 10 10 leads uh per week we can generate but it is overload.  
   
 

### 00:05:34

   
**Robertas V.P.:** It will be not enough time to make video calls, conferences and everything to do everything in a good uh good standard you know.  
**Gabriel Perez:** I I go  
**Robertas V.P.:** Of course the the most the most we see those three days three days through three  
**Gabriel Perez:** ahead.  
**Robertas V.P.:** days and after you will de develop on your own on direct contact but those three days it's quite unique I I not saw other companies we had many contacts with different companies both sides we do or for us do some ICT products and and always even artificial intelligence always most companies ask ah pay advance something like 25,000 or 50,000 euros or dollars that starts like this, you know, and when you say we do a small example just to test it and to see. That's very good. That's very risk-f free. Everybody likes  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** Yes. Yes. Roberto, I'm I'm glad you understand that.  
**Robertas V.P.:** it.  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** Um, that's our differentiator, right? Because we built our own proprietary AI system inhouse, so we can build extremely fast.  
   
 

### 00:06:31

   
**Weipeng Zhuo:** We're completely changing up the way sales uh workflow is done now, right? We build a proof of concept for free. If if if there are like really high ROI proof of concepts we build for that project, we build it for free just to make sure uh the clients gain uh we gain trust with the client um before they even pay.  
**Robertas V.P.:** Yeah. Did you uh saw my email today?  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** Mhm.  
**Robertas V.P.:** I sent for you something like 500\.  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** Yes, sir.  
**Robertas V.P.:** Yeah.  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** Yes,  
**Gabriel Perez:** Yeah.  
**Robertas V.P.:** So only everything we agree with you.  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** sir.  
**Robertas V.P.:** We just need uh the first first uh first moves uh those those points we meet need little bit to rearrange because website it is not existing in it. It website could go in the three on those next moves.  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** Mhm.  
**Robertas V.P.:** Yes.  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** Mhm.  
**Robertas V.P.:** In the point three and it must be jump on the number two not number three but uh exchange with  
   
 

### 00:07:14

   
**Weipeng Zhuo:** Mhm.  
**Robertas V.P.:** number number two maybe maybe exchange maybe not. Yeah. And and uh number number two it is potential two three uh those leads.  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** Mhm.  
**Robertas V.P.:** I have already three five leads. I can directly now for you to email them or if I will manage here I will try  
**Weipeng Zhuo:** Mhm.

**Weipeng Zhuo:** Can you can you do the introduction uh email?
