so anyway appreciate your uh interaction and yes sir i i just i've got um chat doing a rock i guess doing an extract of the last few chapters of the book if you wanted that your for your proof of concept you tell me but so i'm interested in you you'd offered to do some kind of a initial pass i don't really understand the the cost benefit i don't mean dollars i mean in time investment um trade-off for the quality i'll get and uh so you know i've loaded my materials as I said in that proposal but I don't I want to I want higher quality generated responses is like for our marketing I'd like to generate podcasts or not podcasts posts that feel more like I would have said it sure yeah and so I I appreciate I figure the only way I'm going to figure this out is to actually engage with someone and do something and just see what the result is, what the trade-off is for trying to improve them. Gary, I guess what I would appreciate some more context. So you have, so these are like chapters of a book or is it like a you said something about YouTube? Yeah, I've written three books and we're building a new app that we're going to market. And my background is many years in business and it's focused on small and mid-sized organizations. And so I've written three books that cover some of the basic management challenges of running small businesses. And I've done a lot of podcasts and not my own, but interviews with other people and a lot of social media, those sorts of things. And I'd like to pull all that content together and have a more intelligent way to generate responses to questions for future clients or to generate social media posts that are aligned with the new branding of this new product. And so as you can imagine, over the years, the books have been written over, the last one was two years ago with Wiley, and then the first one was probably 15 or 20 years ago. Oh, wow. You know, there's similarities, and there's some things that would enrich, and some things that have been overwritten by a later content. And so just as an example, I loaded all that content into a rag and just started doing some inquiries. And one of the inquiries I gave was, give me advice. I've got a new young person starting a business. And what would be the top five tips I would give them or top three tips I would give them as a new business leader? and it just didn't do a very good job. It pulled some stuff from one book but not the other and it didn't really assess the whole body of content and put it together. You're striking a huge pain point right now with purely just RAG. Yeah. But what tool did you build at RAG? Where was it? Let's see. Is it like a custom GPT thing? It was Claude. Claude, right. But how did you build that thing? Oh, I just used prompts. I said to Claude, I want to load all this data. And it, under the hood, created the... It split things into chapters and somehow did something behind the scenes. Right. So that may not be RAG. Oh, okay. Right, right. That may not be RAG itself. if you just threw all the content like all the books and chapters and podcast transcripts into Claude it's overwhelming contextually it doesn't have you're overwhelming it with the amount of information so processing it might be difficult so that's not actually RAG RAG is when you have huge amount of text information and then you chunk it into smaller bits and you store it into something called vector database where it uses it's called semantic search where if you say hey give me tell me what advice should I give a new incoming entrepreneur right so it's gonna break that question into hey advices for new entrepreneurs, right? So it's going to look for similar words from these chunks of documents. And then that's called similarity search. And then it's going to pull out those chunks that has any mention of new entrepreneur advices, right? Maybe pull out like three or five chunks. And then it's going to embed those three or five chunks to help the AI answer that question. but the the the the issue is so there's just two different things right one is the one that you did is basically you provide cloud with everything and as you can imagine there's a lot more there's a lot less signal to noise ratio right there's a lot of stuff in your content on all the information you provide that's not about tips for young entrepreneurs right so maybe like a tenth or a fifth or one percent of the information you provide is relevant for this question right so it's like drowning in stuff that may not be relevant to come up with your answer the other the rag itself is it's looking for very specific set of information and it actually gives the raw context the raw transcript the raw writing in the chapters that's relevant to this key these keywords and then ask that question right so there's more signal to noise ratio there's more signal being being pulled out but the issue is it might not pull all of it right maybe there's you know uh a combined you know three chapters and like 10 podcasts that's relevant and there's information spread across it but it only pulled out like three of them you know um so there's issues on both both sides that's why i was proposing the proposal I sent is a hybrid of them. Stop me at any time. So we're doing RAC, but we're also using what's called metadata. We're pre-processing your information. For each chapter of your book, we're going to throw it into L\&M, throw it into AI to extract summary of the chapter, what is the prior two chapters, maybe the date of the book that's written, who would benefit this, what type of questions may this chapter be best suited for, right? And then what we do is we can do... Is that referred to as fine-tuning? It's not fine-tuning. This is the most cutting-edge way of advanced question-asking, right? Searching a huge database. Because it started with RAG, and that was all the hype for the past two or three years. And now we have agentic systems, right? So this is a part of an orchestration system of using AI agents. So you have an orchestration system that knows, hey, this question, we should use RAG. This question, we should ingest. We should just look for some of the chapters most relevant, ingest all those chapters. This question is looking for all of the, this question is looking for the most recent information about X, Y, and Z. So it looks, it filters it, it ranks it by time of publication, right? And find the most recent ones related to entrepreneurs. So there's a, there's a. How is that mapping? I mean, that, that sounds like a process that's extremely dependent on identifying the questions in advance. Yes and no. The structure of the metadata, the schema of the metadata database that we extract can be built if you have more information on the type of questions, right? But there's that. And then the other thing I was going to mention is that we also built it for flexibility. So we summarize the chapters. Let's say this chapter or this podcast episode has 10,000 words. We have a one-sentence summary, and then we have a five-sentence summary, and then we have a 20-sentence summary. So then the orchestrator can see what information we need, and then it will look for the type of depth of summary to search for information. So instead of ingesting like what you did with Cloud, instead of ingesting all of the content, all of the information, right, we're actually doing Rack first to find the most relevant chapters and then ingesting the summary of those chapters to say, hey, is that actually relevant? You know, and then does that make any sense? So there's an orchestration. Yeah, I mean, I get the general idea. It's sort of like a schema, if you will, or structure for the data. What is surprising to me is how much work it feels like it would take to do almost manual work. It wouldn't be. So the orchestration is all AI agent. The schema is designed beforehand. The pre-processing of all of your chapters to fit the schema is done every time you upload a new document. So nothing is done manually. and during query time it's actually really fast because of all the pre-processing we've done so this is just a different structure you can tell I don't I have a software background, not an engineer but we've had software companies for decades and I just know I don't know and the fastest way to learn is to do something and so that's kind of where I'm at But the end goal, we've got two use cases that we want to get value out of, that we want to optimize for. The first one is to create social media content. We're going to launch this new product probably in the fall, and we want to start writing about it. It's new branding. It's a new company, and my brand stands for some things historically, so we need to reposition who I am and what we're doing. And I don't want to spend the time to create all that stuff. So we want to write a series of articles and short posts and those kinds of things. And so I would like to just take load of all my content and have this thing be intelligent about knowing, oh, you're launching a new company around these branding pillars. Take my content and generate a roadmap for content creation that is a launch. It says, here, let's talk about these things in this order, and we're building to an understanding of what we're doing. That's use case number one. And in that particular case, you want the voice to be – I want it to feel like something I would have written. I mean, by voice, I don't mean using 11 labs. Right, right. But in our particular case, I am a Christian, and it's really important to us. One of the premises behind our faith is that people are created in the image of God and need to be treated really well. Yes, sir. And so there's principles we want to introduce in how you relate to people, but I don't want to be heavy-handed about faith. You know, I don't want... And so my standard for when an article is written is pretty nuanced. It needs to be principled, rooted in things I would say, principle-wise, or wouldn't say. So my standard on this is pretty high. and I've had other people write content for me and I just wouldn't have quite said it that way and so that's number one number two is the app we're building is is designed to help leaders in a small mid-sized organization do a better job of managing priorities and building relationships with people so that their teams not only execute better, but their whole person health is better. Okay? And so that's a blend of, you know, if you're going to have an enjoyable work life, you need to be in a job that means something to you. You need to be a part of a team that is winning. And you need to have a good relationship. The research from all the research shows that the most important relationship a person has in a business is their direct supervisor. Makes sense. And it correlates more to satisfaction and fulfillment than anything else. And so our target market is small to mid-sized organizations, 10 to 250 people. And only there's 160 million workers in the United States, and only 10 million of them are leaders, the rest are workers. And so what's fascinating is the most people report to the leaders that have the least skill. Right? They don't report to the CEO. They don't report to the middle top layer. They report to frontline supervisors. Makes sense, yeah. Yeah, and so our app is designed to know enough about what they're doing. Like, are you having a one-on-one meeting? Are you having a team meeting? Are you setting priorities? What are your priorities? That we can detect events. That we can say, oh, this person is now getting ready to meet with this person. and we can also do personality assessments and understand the leader is of this personality type and the person they're about to meet with is another personality type. Right. And we take this context and say we want our AI assist, if you will, we want our learning architecture to be event-driven. Event-driven, you said, yeah. Yeah, event \-driven. So that means in context, a leader is getting ready to have a meeting with a team member. And we know, is this a new team member? Is this somebody that's been there a long time? What's her personality type? Are they meeting their goals? Are they not meeting their goals? And we can look at the leader and say, you're an immature leader. You're a young leader. You don't know how to do anything. Or you're a seasoned leader. Take all that context and say, here's how to prepare for this meeting. Love it. That sounds really valuable. Yeah, I think it is really valuable. But you can see what it means is virtually every interaction. The old help systems were static data. Yes, it is. This is completely dynamic. It's also... Every interaction will be unique because... Gary. Sorry to cut you off. I'm getting really excited because we actually just built something like this for our own firm that's really similar, right? And it's using the latest agent tech systems. I want to show you. I want to do a screen share and show you in a bit. But what's the current state of this app development? Like is it done? What do you need help with specifically for that? We'll be having an internal... At the end of February, we'll have an internal version that is dealing with the problem domain of prioritization, not the learning. And we'll build that first. We'll be able to use it. End result is we'd like to have it in people's hands by June. And when I say people, I mean 10, 15 early sites validating proof of concept and those sorts of things. I mean, we've been around. We've been doing this kind of work for 20 years, but we're approaching it completely different. We're starting from scratch. Yes, sir. We're trying to optimize around a new learning model. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. So anyway, that's what we're at. Do you have internal AI engineers or AI architects? What are some needs that you have? Yes, we do. We decided to... I've been in the software business since 1980\. Oh, wow. So... They have softwares back then? Did they what? They have softwares back then? Barely, yeah. There were only two micros at the time. And one was a Commodore Pap and the other was an Apple. And what I got from my 40 years of experience is that when a new platform emerges or a new technology emerges, the innovation usually occurs with startups and not with established players. Yes, sir. Yep. And so I transferred, we sold some businesses, and we have a family office that we do investing in. And we have several businesses in the works. So I transferred my whole engineering team to another project and said that I'm going to hire somebody that is deep into this newer platform. Because our team is used to building software from 20 years ago. Okay, can I share this now? Yeah. You're spot on, right? The technology framework is changing so rapidly. What was basically science fiction a year ago is now possible, right? And you need someone that's constantly focused on the cutting-edge technology and how to apply them. Have you heard of Claude Code? Yes, I have. So Claude Code... It's kind of a leading model. Oh, it's a leading model. Cloud Code has completely innovated a genetic coding framework system. And they are the standard now. That literally happened maybe June of last year, right? So it's only been like half a year-ish. Yeah, right. And it's a huge paradigm shift of how people code. Like, if you're a software engineering company that's not using Cloud Code, you're, like, way behind. But the cool thing is, the ingenuity of Cloud Code is that, one, it's their agentic infrastructure. Two, it's the way they use different frameworks. So they have skills, they have commands, they have agents that you can use to build your own system. So we've built our own systems from software development using the newest technology out there to how I write proposals, right? So I'm going to share with you the Agentex system we built to write proposals. And this is very similar to what you're talking about because there's contextual information that needs to happen, right? We are ingesting, we're automatically ingesting all the meeting transcripts that I have with any lead and their website and what they need into it. And then it comes up with project requirements document, What does this project require? Synthesize that information from all of the meeting transcripts, all the conversations we have on Upwork, any WhatsApp conversation, any email exchanges, automatically updated. It comes up with solution architecture. It does deep research based on the project requirement, does deep research in the web, reads literally hundreds of articles and posts to come up with the best solutions. It architects the solution. with the, I mean, everything is human in the loop, right? With the human in the loop, right? It does the estimation of how much, how long it would take to build this solution. And it builds the proposal and it builds an engagement letter, right? All of these are done in sequence, all involved with humans. The interesting thing is, like you said, Gary, it's contextual, it's context dependent. It's dependent on the client you're talking to, but also it's constantly evolving. Like you said, it's not static. Every time I have a new meeting, I share the project requirement with the client. We talk about it. They're like, oh, I like this, I like this, I don't like that, I don't like that. And actually I will have a budget of X. That gets automatically ingested, and all documents, all deliverables, all documents are automatically updated because of that. I have a meeting with – I go all the way through project requirements to solution architecture to the estimates. I talk to a client. They're like, oh, no, this is way too expensive for me. Let's reduce the scope. I don't want this feature. I don't want that feature. I want to minimize this one and minimize that. So now the AI gets that transcript. Here's the changes from the estimate side. It back propagates to the project requirements to reduce the scope of the requirements. And then forward propagates to rebuild. How good a job is its memory? The memory is insane. Well, the memory is all saved. It's stateful. It's all saved to the... Okay, let me just share with you. It's better to share than just to keep talking. Yeah, well, the reason for the question is I've done similar things that are sort of iterative and evolving, but not using code or not using cloud code. Just for marketing plans or whatever. And what I find is the longer you go, the more it loses context. That is true. It breaks things. That is true. That's why it has something like, okay, let me just share with you what this is, right? So this is all the projects that we worked on since we created this maybe two months ago. There's some claw commands. Here's some improvements that we're working on. Here are all the commands that we do. Commands are basically like, oh, do this, do that, right? Build an engagement letter. Find the gaps. Check the solutions to make sure it works. Do the pre-research. Do the estimate, you know? And then skills is like embedded into the commands. things that updates this claw to be able to do, right? It can do risk assessments. It can validate the research it's done. It can do a timeline roadmap. It can do, it can adhere to the client tone, right? Agents are things that run automatically. It runs automatic consistently checker, right? If you update the estimate document, this agent is going to automatically run and back propagate to see if some of the most urgent client project requirements are actually removed. anything you change, it's going to make sure it's compatible with every other document you have I see little segue here you've referred a couple times to our company give me your background, who you are, what you're doing and then we can return that I went through a PhD program engineering PhD program at Georgia Tech which is the number three engineering school in the country. I did a lot of machine learning. For my research, I did a lot of machine learning and computer vision. I left and went into data engineering for startups, worked on genomic data sets. So we're talking about terabytes of data in just a day. So I was the first engineer for that startup and we built scalable data processing. So we built distributed processing systems to be able to distribute the terabytes of data processing to hundreds of servers and then get in that process. And then ended up at Meta, jumped around to other biotech companies doing data engineering, ended up at Meta as a data scientist, built AI algorithms. That's before generative AI. So like machine learning, traditional machine learning algorithms, predictive modeling, data dashboards, data analytics. Did that for about two years. I decided I wanted to learn more about entrepreneurship. I don't think I need to convince you that entrepreneurship is the route for personal growth and financial freedom and just a lot of learning. Decided to do that when Generate AI got hot because I realized it's going to fundamentally shift the way we do business. And there's so much creativity and room for innovation. So I wanted to do more of my own thing. So that's about two and a half years ago. And right now I run a company, a consultancy company. We focus on AI systems, building custom AI systems. We have a team of four engineers. One is a data scientist still with a PhD background and she used to be a professor in China. She came to the U.S. and she's like taking care of her daughter, so she can only work part-time. So she's working with us. And I have three engineers, full stack and AI engineers. I have a business partner. He's the CTO. I'm the CEO. So basically how we do this is we design solutions. We design solutions, we architect solutions. and then once we have a very, very, very well-defined product requirement document, we hand it over to our engineers and we have daily stand-ups to make sure it gets implemented. And we have our own, like I told you about, internal software, AI software building framework to expedite a lot of the builds. So at the end, you actually save a lot of time and money going through us. Any other questions? Anything you want to make sure? Yeah, just tell me. I mean, the kind of questions we ask, what we coach our leaders to ask their team members, and in a sense you're kind of like that here, is, well, what does winning mean to you? I mean, in life, what does winning mean to you? Gary, I think I do a lot of meditation, so I reflect on stuff a lot. I do a 10-day silent retreat every year. It's been my 10th year doing that. I have a 30-day one coming up. I reflect on that. It's not finance, right? If I wanted to be rich, I would have stuck with better. There's a huge part of it is growth and learning and just becoming a better person. And entrepreneurship is a great vehicle for that. Constantly challenged. Another part of it is connection. Connecting with people. connecting, working with smart, nice and kind human beings. We're very selective with our clients also. We don't work with assholes. And just doing good things. Sounds like a tagline. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, we don't work with assholes. We've encountered some good assholes. Yeah, some rich assholes that are very, very upset that we're not working with them. They're like, what do you mean? Anyways, connecting with good people. And just like genuinely the creativity aspect of it, which is part of the growth, right? Just the AI is going so crazy that there's a gap between the amount of the technology that's there and the application of the technology. So I'm here to like bridge that gap, right? And then connection, right? I'm not just trying to take your money, Gary. I want to be able to work with you. I think you are very interesting and a great person. And I would love to connect with you. So connecting with you, working with you, we have a bootstrap mindset. My co-founder has done a lot of startups and work with startups. So we want to make sure we get you the highest ROI possible. Well, so I think you have – the fact that you're able to answer your question and articulate it tells me you're at a certain stage in your life. Yes, sir. Because some people have just not at the stage where they thought about these things or care to think about them. You know, my framework for life is that – give me some idea of your worldview in terms of – you grew up in China or you grew up in the U.S.? I came here when I was 10, yeah. Okay. So 90% of the people in the world believe that there's life beyond this life. They're just different frameworks for that. And, you know, there's what, a third of them have a Christian worldview, a third have a Muslim Islamic worldview, and then there's the more Eastern Hindu-rooted, those kinds of things. Where in that spectrum, and then there's the atheistic, more humanist. Where do you fit in that? It doesn't affect who I select to work with. It affects how I communicate with you. I was not brought up to be religious. I am very spiritual. I practice a lot of meditation. and with that what is the difference to you between spiritual and religious spirituality is realizing that there is something greater out there that connects us all that brings meaning to the world and that you know that we are in search in continual search of it that helps us connect together to something more powerful I do that through meditation through my connections to some practices I do um I love it uh see I can relate to somebody who is you used the key words you're on a search and I what I where I have you you mentioned don't do business assholes I don't like working with people that are not on a search and I don't care if you agree with my worldview or not. What I care about is that you believe in truth and you're seeking to understand what the truth is. Yes, sir. And then we can be co-workers in life because we do things. The way you learn what's true is you practice it. And if I know you're on a journey to figure out what's true, then we can work together. I love this conversation, by the way. It's so refreshing. But I think I'm leaning more towards Buddhism, but less of the religion aspect of it, but just the Dharma, because of how much I meditate. And I've experienced a lot of things through my deep states of meditation. That's good. I'm just starting some kind of a study on the sort of India history and the way that culture thinks. And I realized, wow, it's a deep topic to try to understand some other culture. And anyway, so I ask all that to say, I'm on a learning journey here. I don't know what I don't know. And I've described two use cases that we need help on. And I want to focus on the first one, which is the marketing one first. The body of input, the body of knowledge I have to put into this thing is a fairly discrete set. I think you and I exchanged. Didn't we exchange? We did. Yep. You know, I've got hours of training videos I've created and I've got a lot of podcasts. podcasts are particularly good where I'm a guest. What I mean they're particularly good is they're extremely dynamic. Somebody asks a question and you give it an answer and you don't answer it the same way every time. And so that body of knowledge is much more dynamic where if you take a book, I've written three books, those are highly structured. You thought through how you wanted to organize everything. And so those books probably give the framework, the interviews give more of the how I talk about that framework, dynamically. So my first priority, I mean, I believe I can learn a lot from you. I just don't want to get, I don't believe I want, I don't want to get consumed in the whole picture. I just want to start in some project and get the learning started. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yeah. So my first priority is to have you guide me to take the body of knowledge I have, get it in whatever form you can start using it, and then create a roadmap for social posts. And we'll use that as the quality checking and say, here's what it proposed. I'll look at the content and say, oh, this isn't right here. You tell me what the tuning process is. Sure. To get to the point, we can use this thing to write content like I would create it. Sounds good. Yeah, I would love to help with that. And then I think phase two, which is far more interesting, is building off of that into the dynamic content that we're going to need in the product, which will become second. Because now we're into social posts. You can plan them. They're more static in the sense that you can pick a topic and articulate it. You know what the topic is. Where in the product, it's going to be more dynamic. Oh, I'm coming into this meeting. I'm having this problem with this person. Their personality is this. Mine is this. That's very, very dynamic. So that's phase two. Right, right. So how do we get started? How do you make a proposal to me and what's next? I have a proposal builder. I can make a proposal to you. I would think I want to show you some things, Gary. So this is also how I do things, right? You know, I would love to take your buddy and get started, but I also want to prove my competency before you give me that buddy. By the way, that's why I talked to you. You spoke. I had, I don't know, 30 responses. But you said, I'll give you a proof of concept. And you just kept asking for more content. Yeah. That's why I'm talking to you. And still, right? I was like, hey, let me show you something before we advance. Again, that's because of the way we built our operation system to completely deconstruct and renovate the sales process, right? We can build a proof of concept really, really fast if we have the right contents because we are in an AI building framework. So if you can send me at least, you know, that book, anything about that book, so that at least I have some, my AI has some context on how to market it, you know? Or if you have some sort of marketing campaign, you know? I can send you the book. You need to – it's – Wiley published it. Oh, it's already published? Yes. Okay. The latest book is published by Wiley. I can send you all the books. Sure. The Wiley version, the latest one, and the one that is sort of the one where I spend more time integrating biblical principles into the business world, is the one I would want to use as sort of the framework. The earlier books have a lot of business wisdom in them, but they would need to be tied into this other framework. The only caution I make in sending you, if I send you the Wiley PDF, it needs to be not get into the public domain. Oh, for sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, because it's their licensed content, and I have an agreement with them. Agreed, agreed, yeah. We can do that. Just send me the most recent book that you want to market, and I'll provide you two things. And then we can hop on another call. I'll provide you one is a rack component where you can just do question and answering, right? And then from the book. So again, this proof of concept is just a proof of concept, right? It's not going to be perfect, but I want to show you that I am putting in the faith to show you and putting in time to show you what we can build so then you have trust. This RAC component is just a question to answer anything. Second thing is I will build you something similar to what I have for the proposal builder that allows us to build, like you said, a content roadmap, a content strategy, and maybe one or two posts within that content roadmap. Based on the way you speak, the framework that you talk from your podcast episodes and then maybe during a call, I can live demonstrate coming up with a new roadmap or a new piece of content. And then if you like it, if it's sufficiently a good POC to show you that the concept that you're proposing can be done, then we can come up with a proposal and build on top of that. So let's assume that we do move beyond that to actual proposal. Give me some idea that time horizon, the elapsed time in how much of my time it's going to take to get the system attuned. I don't mean that in a technical word. I just mean that it – I assume there's some iterative process that takes place. Yeah, yeah, yeah. How much – is that going to take two months or four months? honestly maybe like a month we would have we will build you we will build you something in three weeks and then you spend a week playing around with it yeah okay and then we'll see where that goes so like a month to something that you can use and then we can keep tuning it up the more you play around with it yeah okay All right. That sounds perfect. I love it. Yes, sir. And then just in general, how do you guys bill for your time? Do you do most of your work throughout work or do you do it? No, we try not to do it throughout work because they take a percentage of it. Yeah, okay. But we bill hourly. We bill hourly, and I can submit you a bill every two weeks, the invoice every two weeks. it would be yeah 120 an hour and we'll have we can give you a spreadsheet of the hours logged and what's being done for those hours so there's transparency so you prefer hourly to fixed fee which is fine with me either way so why do you do you just go to if you don't like doing business stuff do you just do it to prospect it's mostly for prospecting So how do we honor the Upwork? Can we do one contract with them and then do other contracts outside of that system? What is your relationship contractually with Upwork? You understand what I mean? I've had people want to go around the system. We can go through Upwork. I don't mind. We can do the first one through Upwork. Yeah. Well, Upwork invested to do all this stuff. and you should honor whatever the agreement you have with them. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We pay Upwork enough, buddy, for our connects that we spend. But yes, we can go through Upwork. Maybe for the first place. I don't have a problem switching off of it once we've compensated them for it. Let's do it. Let's do it. I like that. Yeah, yeah, we can go through Upwork. And then any further phases, then we can kind of move out. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's fine. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yeah, I assume they deal with that when you sign up with them, how they want you to work with them. Okay, well, the next thing is that I'll get you some documents. I think, well, for the proof of concept, is that enough of the book or do you need the – how much stuff do you need? Do you need the – much honestly does this conversation is is is is good enough um but but but the book i just need what the book is about like a summary of the book almost you so you don't actually have to send me the whole thing like what's the book about maybe the intro chapter um well actually if you do send me a whole thing i can do a rag on the book itself so then you know what questions to ask okay yeah Yeah, let's do that. Yeah, I don't mind sending you the books. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So just the book. The book is fine. And then maybe the platforms that you want to market on, you know, because the post is going to be different depending on the platforms, right? And what type of marketing you want? Is it like LinkedIn posts? Is it like Instagram posts or like Twitter posts or something? Yeah, we'll be on LinkedIn. That's our primary. Okay, okay. And we're posting now a couple times a week. So do you want it like three times a week, LinkedIn, for a whole month? We want to go heavier with this launch and get a new branding. So we'll want to go to three times. We've been doing two. So if you give me some sort of branding description, like what is the branding direction that you're trying to go forward with? Okay. Then I can integrate that into the AI. Well, we did a fair amount of research, 15 different surveys, that the results of that have a lot of description of how our target market thinks about describing the problems they want to solve. So I can send you that. I know whenever I do market planning with chat, I always input that so it knows the language of our target customer. perfect I love it yeah yeah yeah okay um alright Gary I have to go but it's been an absolute pleasure meeting with you and thank you for the questions and the deep discussions uh yeah it's refreshing it helps to know each other a little bit so yes sir yes sir alright thank you thank you have a nice day bye bye
