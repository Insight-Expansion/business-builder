ur ur Hey. Hello. How's it going? Hey, how are you? I'm good. Doing well. How are you? I'm good. I'm in Hawaii right now. You went to Hawaii? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just landed yesterday. That's amazing. You see the us people working from home. Huh? Working from home. oh yeah yeah i'm also working home from but my home is in hawaii now working from an airbnb i guess yeah ah where are you where you usually you usually work like on the go you live in dc i live in dc yeah okay so it's the same time zone as miami right yep okay it's a five hour difference here though it was like yeah yeah for you it's noon yeah it's crazy fucking woke up at 4 a.m today bro really yeah because you're not used to it all right interesting so but you look very young you look like you're 24 man 37 oh my god man it's the asian the asian oh my god do a lot of yoga too so that helps wow yoga no it's jeans mostly jeans i'm sure i'm sure oh yeah but that's okay all right great yeah no my daughter and my wife left so i have to so i can talk so i have some Some quiet. Are you married? No, sir. Okay. All right. So let's get into it. I'm curious. Your background is very strong. I usually tell, to be honest, I usually tell all the candidates. I send them like a candy tech test, kind of. Let them see, get a feel. But with you, I just wanted to jump on a call. I just wanted to see what, you know, to meet you. I appreciate that. Yeah, so I think you have a strong background, so I think it should be fine. So did you understand, like, what we do? I mean, you want to design a rag system? Well, no, not just a rag system, right? I only had a couple minutes to read it. I was, like, in between. Yeah, that's fine. I'll just tell you. It's not a test. Sure, sure. So what we do is basically, you know what? You know what? The best thing to do will be I'll share my screen. I'll show you a video of, I think, 90 seconds or something. Yes, sir. And you can know exactly what we do. Okay, let me see. All right. Where is the video? Okay, wait. Oh, that's a cool little, like, window stacking thing on the left side. Yeah. Someone taught me this in Apple. Oh, sick. All right, here it is. Contractors lose money every single day because they don't actually know what happens in their sales meetings. Your reps meet customers in different homes, different situations with real money on the table. But you don't hear the conversations. You don't see the objections. You don't notice the buying signals they missed. And you don't know why deals close or why they fall apart. So you guess, you hope, and you keep losing money. Gold Pro stops that. Gold Pro records every meeting, in person or on the phone, and shows you exactly what happened in simple, clear AI insights. A full performance score for every meeting, laser-focused coaching, deal likelihood, buying signals, red flags, objections, missed opportunities. For the first time, you see the truth behind your sales. And the moment the meeting ends, GoldPro creates all your paperwork automatically. A complete scope of work, an accurate estimate, a clean contract, dedicated follow-ups, all generated in seconds. No typing, no mistakes, no delays. Your reps get sharper, your pipeline gets clearer, your decisions get smarter, and your close rates rise fast. This isn't another CRM or another AI note taker. This is the new sales system for contractors. Gold Pro. Just talk. We'll handle the rest. I love it. You get the idea? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, so basically mostly remodeling companies. Oh, for remodeling companies? Yeah, it's just remodeling. So when people go to, you know, because that's the whole business. They get leads, expensive leads, and then they send the rep to, you know, to sell the lead. I was an owner, five years owner of a remodeling company, so I know all the ins and outs of it. So it's basically an in production. It's almost ready. So I don't know. We need to, I just want someone I can trust to build the whole thing. I mean, do you think, what do you think about this? your name israel right is that what you're saying bro man i'm gonna shock your mind like uh we built so so many similar stuff already um uh the most recent one we built is a um a uh live sales coaching platform so it's hooked up to any of your virtual calls so this is not in person right this is like virtual calls this is in person oh what you did is not okay what we what we did was, uh, like remote, remote virtual calls. It like, uh, it listens to every conversation you have with the, with the lead. And it basically comes up with like, you know, objection handling, like things to say, uh, directions, uh, it's like ClueDy, but we build it for, for, for a different client. Right. So when you say we, who's we, I work at, I, I, I work, uh, I'm a CEO of a firm. We have a handful of engineers. I do the architecting, right? I come up with solutions. I build the architectural design. I build the blueprint, and then the engineers just go and implement it. So I do all the ideation and, like, designing of the systems. The coding is the easy part because we have AI systems that basically code now. Yeah. Right. Do you do UX UI or no? Huh? UX UI? I don't know. We have UX, UI talent, sure. Oh, okay. No, I'm just asking. I don't know about you. So you're an agency, basically. We're a little different than an agency. We're part product, part service. So we do a lot of ROD in-house. We build a lot of AI technology to build faster and better. I want to show you something that we're building, actually, that might be relevant to this, that we're building in-house. I went off track, but you said you wanted to blow my mind with this. Well, I guess it didn't blow your mind. So, yeah, it's kind of like Cooley, but specifically for sales agents. It also does a – after the meeting ends, it comes up with a set of post-meeting summaries. It drafts an email that you can just copy and paste and send it to your lead. But just follow \-up? Follow-up email. We've also worked with a law firm client where we build something similar, but it's hooked up to its post hoc meeting analysis. It's hooked up to their Google Meets, and they record. They will automatically record the meets, and after the meeting ends, it automatically generates a form that's already filled out on the client's needs, all the information and then automatically sends over to their CRM. And also crafts emails that they can send and reminder emails that's automatically implemented for the client if they don't, you know, if you haven't heard back in a couple of days. That's very similar. That's very similar. Yeah. Very similar. Our company, yeah, go ahead. Our company ourselves, like I record all my meetings. And immediately once it gets recorded, It gets sent over to our Notion. That's what we use for CRM. We custom build our own CRM. And it generates all the tasks. So Notion is our project management and our CRM. Automatically generates all the tasks that need to be done, assigns the right engineers and right personnel and right clients associated with it, and it adds a priority level and any associated documents. So we don't have to go in and create tasks. It's all generated from our meetings. Interesting. And another thing, let me show you this thing real quick. So again, we do a lot of R\&D in-house, right? Just because the AI tools out there is absolutely fucking insane. And it's just so much fun building stuff. So I don't know if you've seen a coding interface before. This is like a coding interface. But the cool thing, what you see here, it's called Proposal Builder. So since we got it running, all the projects we have are in here, like leads we have. basically what it does is it looks at um for each uh project so i look for upwork projects right for each project um it automatically sends over well some are automated some are manual like any meeting references right so like upward messaging project description from upwork any document they send over the documents i have to like um yeah manually put inside um transcripts uh meeting transcripts are automatically ingested in here, right? And then it automatically comes up with, you know, internal facing client discovery nodes. So every time we meet, it will automatically update the nodes on this project, what the project requirements are, and it generates client facing. Let me see. This one's a new one. Let's see. It automatically generates, you know, a requirement summary, solution summary. What's the proposal like? it does like deep research to figure out what the industry competitors are so now so that's one thing oh man another fucking crazy thing is we actually build a prototype like anything that's like UI heavy we actually build a fucking new prototype for free for the lead right because everything is so automated so it's so easy for us to do right so you build a prototype we build a proof of concept so you use lovable i use lovable but it's all automated right so so from the oh my god so everything is you you get to the client a demo of what he's gonna see right that's after one call after one call i have the meeting transcripts uh i have the project descriptions the ai does research on what's the best solution to build ai does research on how to what the UI should look like, you know, design the, design the lovable prompt. So it's like a full prompt and you, and then it gives you a link where you click on it and it brings up the lovable interface and you just, you just send, send, and it basically creates the thing. And the AI has full context of this project, right? So it will create prompts much better than I can create. And it does all the research. Basically, it'll, it'll, it'll know everything about it more than you and research more. and you can do some things that people can't do. Exactly. That's the future. That's what it is. That's what it is. That's the fucking future, bro. And we're extending it now to Business Builder. So right now, it's just a proposal. It's just a sales phase. We're extending it to basically touch on every fucking thing we do, right? Every meeting, internal meeting gets updated. Every text. I want to say text. Every text. Every Slack. Every WhatsApp. Every project is updated automatically. When the project ends, it automatically comes up with a case study and like testimonial request email, right? Get that posted. Yeah, we're extending that to our whole company, man. So that's what we need to do. Everything, it's like, it's basically like CloudBot. Basically like CloudBot, yeah. Except much better security, hopefully, yeah. Security, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Security is crazy with ClawBot. I don't know. Did you install it? Nah, man. I ain't trying to fuck shit up. Not right now. Yeah, I can't. Yeah, too much sensitive stuff in here. Yeah, I know. I know. But it's easy to implement? ClawBot or this thing? It's easy to implement. ClawBot, yeah, it's not bad. Like Apple Mini, right? Yeah, yeah. You don't even need an Apple Mini. Yeah, you can do it on the cloud, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Interesting. Okay, look, listen. It sounds like you're very, very good and very good fit, but the problem is you're an agency. You're not like someone that can run with me. You know what I mean? And your price is probably going to be higher. I mean, what are you looking for, actually? What do you mean by run with you? Because I was looking for like a long term, you know, like at least like three months hands on because this is the part. So everything you see right now is being built. It's going to be ready probably in a month. Maybe if you come in and look at things, maybe you can speed things up. Yeah, sure. But it's going to be the part where I sold it to a customer before I even have a product. People love it. I was in the industry. I know everybody who wants it. I have a marketing system in place. Just go and everything will start working. It's going to be like at least in the hundreds of millions, I think, exit if we sell. But I need – this is the part where we get new clients, start working Q\&A, everything. So this is the critical part. It's the finished building, having new testing, new clients, and then support and problems and tickets and everything. So it needs to be very solid. I need to have someone that I can actually trust with this system. This is why I'm doing a huge, I have like 60 people applied. Of course, 30 of them are from India or something like that. I'm not interested. I want to get someone hands-on that I can speak, that I can actually talk to. and build stuff for me. And I have things that I'm doing on my own. Help me make more money, make money together. I don't know, like grow with someone. Because I'm an entrepreneur. I know how to make money. That's what I know. I know how to make money. You know how to build all that shit in the background? I'll tell you what to build. Let me make money off of that. That's what I tell everybody. That's why they're really interested in that. Well, let me say something. So engineers usually don't have a lot of entrepreneurial or innovative. thinking. They just code. And now with AI, coding is fucking easy, bro. That's why I don't actually do the coding itself. We just outsource it to our engineers. Our engineers are fucking great. I've been working with them for years. And it's not like you just press a button and they do it. We have really, really perfected our own AI system workflows that requires human in the loop and a lot of automated testing to make sure everything's good. So it's the same thing that teams of people would do. Now it's handled by AI and a senior engineer that we hire. So that's number one. It's much cheaper because we do things faster and better than like anyone out there. A team of Indian people gets two charges like 30 bucks an hour, whatever. Better product, better reliability, and just good things, right? So that's the coding side. But this shit that we're talking about here, this innovation that we're creating here, the R\&D that we're creating, comes from my head. You know what I'm saying? Like, it's from people like us that have entrepreneurial capabilities that knows about business and knows how to sell, knows what's needed, right? You don't get that from a coder. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, I don't need it. So my team has these people. I am like this. So I don't necessarily need that. Yes, it could help. To talk to someone who understands business and code and can connect between the two and can talk to everybody and make sure the AI is working and implement AI systems in our business like you have in your business. So, you know what I mean? I need someone like you, but full time. Israel, I also do fractional CTO work, right? So, I can just work with you on an hourly basis. We can design stuff and have your engineers take care of it. In the meantime, I'll teach your engineers some cool coding systems that we've developed so they can speed their shit up. You know what I'm saying? And I want to improve. I want you to be, look, you like money, right? For sure you like money. We all like money. I have ideas in my head that if I could execute, would make a lot of money. So if we work together, do you think you can help me and we can build stuff together regardless? For sure. Fuck yeah, dude. Like I said, we can build a fucking idea executor, you know, AI system. All I need to do is just sell it. Can I just sell it? You just fucking sell it, bro. You give me the infrastructure to sell it, I will sell it. Yeah, yeah. Whatever you like. I will design it. We'll figure out a technical solution. Either your team implementing it, or we can implement it. My team implementing it, but the thing is we can just do that, right? I'll be the architectural yeah i i have i have a few people working for me so that's the thing i have a few people working for me i need to work together with them as a team because they're not full-time sure they are they have a percentage in the company very very small percentage and i'm not sure that i'm gonna even give it to them because it's in a contract to see how they perform so if they don't perform they don't get the the percentage right they'll just get money for the work they did and that's it but i want because if i don't trust them enough because this company is going to be a hundred million dollar company minimum minimum minimum i'm telling you it's gonna be crazy all the remodeling industry will do it it's the messiest industry in the u.s and nobody records their call nobody knows what the fuck's going on in their business if you just record your calls i'll have everything ready for you not you don't need contracts imagine if you're trying to open a remodeling company you don't need anything you just need gold pro you just install it you record the meetings we will do the proposals we will do the contract we will do the follow-up for you we We'll do the estimate. We'll do everything. The scope of work for the contractor. It's basically. That's what I built for my company already. You know what I'm saying? Which is plug and play. You know what I'm saying? Put that into your mobile app and we're good to go. And another client that we've been working on is a construction company. But they fixed like fucking roof leaks and shit, right? Okay. We're building a mobile app where they walk around and they point the videos. And then it will tell the technician what to look at and what to zoom in closer. So there's a video, live processing video AI that records the walkthrough and tells the construction person or technician what to look at. What's not looking good or what to fix? It's not looking good. can you zoom in on this part of this stuff? Can you narrate this? Basically, the AI tells the worker what to do. The AI supplements criteria for the worker that needs to be done, right? Because sometimes you hire new workers that don't know shit, so the quality isn't well, right? So this one is like, hey, baseline, you have to get these fucking things done, and you make sure you go to this other room and get these fucking things done, right? And then that information, again, same thing, gets ingested. The transcript is ingested. The videos, AI takes snapshots of different parts, right? That gets ingested. Send it over to create proposals, you know, with pictures. The pipeline is also connected. That's amazing. So we can implement even pictures and videos. This is the next steps we're going to do. Yeah. You know, we create for the people. Look, basically, the reason everybody joined me, one of my partners is someone who already did an exit in another company. He exited another company and he came back and he said like, okay, he posted on a group what I'm in for entrepreneurs. He said, I'm looking for the next exit and I'm looking for the best thing. Like he got 150 people talking to him, telling him about the company. He got in with me for 5%. You know, so I know exactly what to do for these remodeling companies. I know how I can sell it. It's the, we only need like, I think 670 clients for like 80 million evaluation, something like that. Fuck yeah, yeah, dude. Hell yeah. So it's pretty amazing. And they pay, they have money, they're messy, they don't know technology. They need this. And if you get a big player and you catch like even just 1% of the industry, you're crazy. But of course, everybody says that, but this is something that actually works. So if you can plug and play and you can run with me, how is this going to work? How can I – how available actually you will be? You know what I mean? So like I said, I do two things, right? One is I run this company. Two is I have a co-founder who does a lot of this stuff. Two is I work as a fractional CTO, right? So I can work with you on the fractional CTO aspect of it, right? By hourly basis, at least for now. You know what I'm saying? Like I see it as a dating phase. We work together and see how we're compatible, right? I don't want to just jump in. You don't want to give me X percent of equity immediately. We work together. I'll come visit. We'll hang out. We'll smoke some, right? Figure out how compatible we are. Come up with some questions, some ideas, right? I'll show you some proof of concept and build some shit when you fuck around. And if things work out, sure, I'll take some equity, right? And we can kind of renegotiate and change some things up. But I think for the dating phase, right? Dating phase, yeah. So I'm looking for it. This is why the whole system I built to find someone, this is why I built the whole thing. I want to – basically the bottom line is I need someone who knows their shit, knows what they're doing. You can build things. You can actually build things and execute. Yeah. And run with me, you know, for a long term. I'm looking for someone that can tell me, okay, look, I know this is, you know, it's fine. Let's work together. Let's decide, let's say on a, on a whatever, monthly even salary that we can agree. And basically we're full time together for these like two, three months. And then of course we can, I mean, after a month we'll know if we're good or not. Right. Right. And then we can talk after a month even. I don't mind. I have all the equity in the company. Like most of the equity on the company is me. Large, large, large. So I can decide things. If I see that this is like, this can be huge. And we probably will go to another industry. We'll go to insurance. I have people from insurance calling me. Mortgage brokers calling me. Telling me that they want this for them too. So there's a lot of ways to grow. Yeah. I'm down to go where the money is at, bro. I like money. If you like money, I'm down to go where the money is at, right? Bro, once you see 50 customers that pay, each customer is an LTV. They pay about $30,000 a year. And we have 100 of those. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you understand? So it's ridiculous. I mean, it's just nonsense. Let's just build it. That's what I tell my team. Build this to me so I can sell it. I have people ready. I just sold to another client in Miami right here. They called me. They worked in a company who uses my services. They open a new company. They call me. I close them 8K for three months. Damn. You know, so it's not really, it's not yet moving forward, but I'm telling you, like, the hype is crazy about this. Everybody, everybody's going to use it. I bet. I'm so, yeah. You sound like you can actually, you can actually, you know, work it. You can actually implement this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm down, right? The most I can do right now is real, just because I'm trying to cover my ass, just in case it doesn't work out. You don't like me. Well, I don't like you. Something doesn't happen. We're doing it. Right. Most I can do is probably 20 hours a week, which is enough. Everything I do is AI native. Right. I turn out shit like faster than anyone can. So 20 hours is like two times full time for anybody else. Really? Yeah. I mean, I assume so. Because you also build things in alignment with this, you know? Yeah, yeah. We have infrastructure for me to turn on this shit so fast. You know what I'm saying? Okay, I'll tell you what I – I'll tell you, for example. Sorry to stop you. But I'll tell you, for example, what I need right now. And you tell me how you go about it, okay? Right now I have everything ready, almost. Just we need the new version of the app. The app has already existed. It's in the App Store. Sure. I saw it, yeah. Yeah. So all we need is just to make it the version that you see on the video. Because the version we have now is like the beta. But the next version, which will come out in March, hopefully. That's why I'm doing this. And I'm bringing someone on to make it faster. So once this is ready, we have prompts for the results. So, for example, there's a sales call. They record it on the phone. It's transcribed. and then we need to send it to, you know, prompting. And we have database and we need the data points to appear every time at the same place, make sure that all the outputs are correct, no hallucination, all that. That's all we need to build. And we have like, we have all the scheme ready. It tells you where to put the red flags in the conversation, where to put, you know, the objection handling, where to put the missing opportunity, where to put all that, all this information. We have all that. We just need to implement it in. and make sure it's accurate in real time. And I think it's called the RAG system, right, that remembers everything, that remembers everything that happened. And then every time the salesperson goes to another meeting, another meeting, another meeting, we can generate a report for him for the week, how he did throughout the week or the month. And this is amazing because it's hard to train when you don't know what happens in the sales calls, basically. Right, right. Now I hear you. I hear you. What are you thinking? To be honest, I can't build a proof of concept for this for you for free by next week. Right? But the difficult part, that's the thing, Israel. If I build something from nothing, it's actually faster than building something on top of your system. But I think we need to build it on top of your system, right? We have to. you think you can build it faster by yourself without the system that I have? So there's a lot. So I can build the core aspect of it. Send in a meeting video or a meeting transcript. You throw the prompt together. You get all the analysis, the KPI, the metrics, and see how that differs over time. I can build that shit for you in a week. Because our system is so good at building from nothing. Bro. But there's a lot more to that than just – there's a lot more to a production system than just that core. Exactly. If I let you speak to my partner, he'll tell me, yeah, he's right. He can build it in a week. But we have so many things that we need to do. Exactly. I guess what I'm saying is to build that feature, is not hard. What's hard is understanding what's already existing and then how to best integrate it to what's already existing without fucking everything else up. Exactly. And I need to make sure... You nailed it. I need to make sure my AI framework that we built internally for the past year can be compatible with an existing code base and then do the build that we want, right? which is fully doable. That will take some time. That's the thing, because he told me. It's not that someone comes in and they start working, they need to understand the system that's already existing, and they need to understand it, and that takes time. I said, okay, even if it takes time, even if it takes three days, okay, let's start doing it. Let's start letting someone take a look at it and understand it. My proposal, Israel, is we can start however many hours. for me, but I would really appreciate if you can bring on at least some hours for my senior engineer who built this system herself and really, really fucking good at using the AI system that we built, right? Even like 5-10 hours a week of her time, right, will carve out a ton of time, will save you a fuck ton of money and increase efficiency of your current development team if we start to integrate our system into it. You know what I'm saying? How do we, how can I, so number one is the first thing that came to my mind. How can I make sure of that? How can I make sure of that? But it's hard to know until we start working together and talk and see the communication and see how available you are. This is basically the most important thing for me. I'm going to tell you, I just need, you know, I just need it to be available to me all the time. And then we'll just knock shit, you know, it's fine if you can't do it right at the moment. But I'm saying I just want to run fast because I know there's money waiting for me. Money is waiting for me, brother. You have to understand. That's what I tell my team. Let me make money. Let me make money. Let me show to one company. I'm telling you, this is a community. I give one company this thing. If it works the way I want it to work, it's game over. It's game over. You get 20 that same week. You get 20 more that same week. Yeah. I get you, bro. Yeah. And it's a startup, and I can't spend too much money. So I need to find the balance. on where to put the money smart and have someone run with me. And if it works, I'll let you enjoy it too. You build it with me, okay. I'll let you enjoy the money of it too. I'm not going to... I don't know. It's not fun to fly first by yourself. So, all right. So, you needed lunch by mid-March, you said? I needed lunch yesterday. Sorry, you froze. What did you say? Okay, I said I need it launched yesterday. Uh-huh. But the fastest it could be, yeah, of course. Again, I think the fastest we can be is we can take at least just like five or ten hours of my engineer's time, right? I can do ten hours with you just to make sure we reduce the budget a week. Five to ten hours of my engineer's time, ten hours of my time a week, and we'll fucking go lightning speed, right? We can start. And their rate is lower than yours? Oh, yeah, for sure. Yeah. We can start this week, right? She can go in and start reading the code base. We have AI systems for everything, right? She reads the code base, understand where the gaps are. We can architect a plan to integrate what's in the video into your code base. I'll start working on that immediately, right? And we can guarantee. Well, after we read it, because I actually don't know what your code base is, right? I don't know if it's shit or if it's good. If it's shit, it might take a while. If it's good, then maybe not, right? So maybe we do an initial fixed price of discovery for a week. Figure out what your code base is. Design the process. Design an architectural blueprint of how to implement it and whatnot, right? And then we can talk about how much – like we can do fixed price, like you said, if you want. or on an hourly basis, how many hours, to get into the finish line and how long it will take. But again, we are fucking efficient and stuff. Like five hours of her time, five hours of my time is like two or three times more than what you can hire from. I'm sure because you have the AI systems in place. But I'll be honest with you. I want more than this. If I'm getting in a relationship, we talk, we understand each other, dating to get married bro i ain't fucking around man you know what i'm saying okay you said you're open later for uh for a partnership yeah yeah i go where the money is all yeah i mean it's gonna be easy easy decision for you in three months you'll know how many customers we get what's going on how's the business going how everybody's happy about it and then you'll say okay yeah of course i want to go in there but uh if not then you'll you know no okay it doesn't work okay yeah if it move down, buy an apartment next to you, you know? Yeah. Smoke the probe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Killer world. Yeah, yeah. Bro, I got to make like, I need to make a lot of money. You'll get to know me. It's not just, you know, a lot of money people say like 10 million. I need a billion. I need a billion. Let's go. You know? So this is my mindset. This is what I want. And I want someone to run with me. I need you.

You know? Exactly. Execution is cheap here. It's amazing that you say that because for me, that's the part where I don't have it. Yeah. I have everything else. I just don't have what you have. And I have not yet found someone who could be in that place with me. Yeah. Yeah. For me, it's the opposite, right? Execution is cheap. We just don't have domain expertise, you know? or the network within that domain. The network selling. I understand that, all the front end. That's what I did all my life. I'm a salesman. That's what I do. You know, I just saw the project for a million dollars for some client and watching. God damn. You know, and so I know how to do stuff. But this is, it's not mine. I'm getting just commissioned. But for this company, bro, I'm telling you, it can blow if it performs well. Listen to me. This is what I said to all my partners when we started. I told them, listen, if you can make this app work the way I want to, this will be worth millions. That's it. That's all you got to do. That's what I tell them. That's all you got to do. That's it. And you have the confidence. You know how to do it. You have everything it needs. It seems like. It really do. It seems like. I think I'm going to cancel everyone else. And I'm going to say to my partner, hey, look, we probably found the one. Let's just have a conversation with them. Let's see how we structure, get into a little technical and move forward. That's what I'm thinking. I'm down, bro. I'm down. Yeah, yeah. I mean, if you have the time, I would encourage you to talk to other people too just to see the fucking differences. I know, I know. No, I have like someone who had a Yale PhD and I have someone who did things similar to what we do. But I don't know. I don't know. I just feel like I need to speak to someone, speak English to someone. It's the ingenuity and creativity and the business mindset, you know, is like really the big thing that I'm offering. Right. I've been building shit internally, like R\&D, because of the creativity, you know, for the past year. And that's why I can demo all the shit for you. I can build a demo before anyone even pay me or like meet with me. No one else in the market can do that right now. You know what I'm saying? That's actually very smart. You see, that's the thing. You can do anything you can think of. you have to be creative. Once you're creative, you can build anything with AI. And this is amazing. Like a present, a fucking proof of concept after a call. That's crazy. That's what I did. But I'm steroid. No one's doing that. And like, no one completely, you gotta think outside the box, right? We're completely changing the way sales is done. Right? I tell my friends, they're like, they're like, what the fuck are you doing? You're spending hours and hours building proof of concept before even like you got the money. Like, I'm like, nah, man, I spent 30 minutes. All right. And our convergence are insane because of that. That's what I'm saying. The people like you who thinks forward, who see forward, these are the people who are going to make it in this era. Bro, it's like discovering fire. For me, AI is like discovering fire, bro. It's changing the world completely. Yeah, I love the beauty. I'm ready to work together. I want you to be by myself. I'm desperately – to be honest with you, I desperately need someone to speak to about my ideas and get them executed and make money quick. Yeah. I hired some fucking dude to build me just a small automation that takes like a course, put it into an API, transcribe, summarize, and put it into gamma for a presentation for someone who wants a course. This could make me money, bro. I'm telling you, I have customers for this. And it takes them like, bro, like 14 days now. And now it says Bro, I can do that shit for you this afternoon. That's what I'm saying. You do it in three hours. You know what I mean? And I'm exaggerating. So if I have someone like this on my side, let's do it. Okay. I think let's get to business. Tomorrow, are you still in Hawaii? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, tomorrow you're going to be in Hawaii. So what time is it for you? Israel time, 8.30. 8.30 is real time. What time is it for you? Israel time, okay. You know what? It's going to be 1.30 here. EST, 1.30 EST. Yeah, it's like five hour difference. So 7, oh, 8 p.m. 8 a.m. 8 a.m. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We can do that. And do you want to bring your senior engineer too or no? I can bring my... It doesn't matter. I don't think it's needed. Yeah. I can bring my co-founder if you want to meet with them too. I just need to know you run with me and we're running through the money. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I think we've got to build this as fast as possible, put it on the market as fast as possible. I'm ready to start advertising everything, ready to take calls. I have salespeople ready to take calls and sell. This could make, I'm telling you, this could make like at least $100,000 a month for a start. At least. Let's fucking go, bro. Yeah, tomorrow we'll chat some more. Let's start. What do you think about the monthly thing? What do you think you can take minimum to run this with whatever, however it's important to you to run this? I don't know. First week, 20 hours. And after you say, okay, I just need 10 hours to fine-tune. work together, start building it out. What do you think is the minimum that you would take for an adventure like that? And include your engineer as well inside. For me, I'm thinking 10 hours a week. Four weeks a month, right? That's 40 hours. So I actually charge $200 for like CTO work. But engineer, I charged $120. But I think we can do a fixed price, maybe like $10,000 a month. How does that sound for the engineer in my time? Enough to get some shit billed. But that's what I'm scared. But how available will you be? You know what I mean? That's the most important thing for me. I just need you to, like, if something, how can we measure this? How can I know you're going to say, don't worry, it's going to happen quickly. How can I measure this? You know what I mean? Ten hours a week? What is that going to do? Look at the code, run things, move things forward. I don't even know, you know? I don't even know. Dude, like, hour barely makes sense these days because, like, the value that we bring is so much faster. And so much more than the actual hour we put in, right? 10 hours of my engineer's time is like 40 hours of any other engineer's time. That's what I'm saying, right? So the ratio is one to four. At least. That's what I'm saying. If we do a fixed price for the first week of just a discovery phase and we set up like, hey, deliverables. At the end of this week, you will give me A, B, C, and D and we'll figure out how to move forward. We have a roadmap of how to move forward. and we have the whole code base analyzed and know exactly what features need to add, how long things will take. We will fucking get there. That's the value that we promised, the value that we're going to get. You know what I'm saying? And then you can be safe. You're like, okay, yeah, let's fucking go. But you don't have to commit to 10K in a month. But I do have a feeling about this. If I go with you, I don't want to deal with anybody else. I don't want to deal with anybody else. more i want i want this to be the last thing and and if you open to equity later right i mean you you will you will want it because if you know if you don't see customers you wouldn't want it but it doesn't matter what i'm saying is if we can start with the same thing you said and and and push it for eight grand a month i will tell you okay but i just but i just need to see like to to make sure the communication is good. We talk all the time. We update everything. I mean, I'm sure you're very efficient with your time and how you communicate with other team members. I just want it to be as efficient as it could be and just make things run. I'll give you my phone number, bro. You can just text me. You know, call me at fucking 3 a.m. if you're bored or whatever. We can have like, you know, like, let's fucking go. I'm sick of one night stands, bro. Yeah, I'm dating for marriage, man. That's what I'm telling you. yeah yeah yeah yeah no that works uh if you want you know if if things go well monday with the chat with your partner i'll fly down i'll fly down hang out watch it may be hawaii until sunday and then maybe next week i can i can come down and chill for a bit yeah yeah for sure we'll start i think we'll start to work together if you agree to this and if you push if you pull pull the trigger and actually do what you're gonna do your best basically it's not like you say hey 10 hours 8 hours 11 hours doesn't fucking matter i want things done you know what i mean just get things done and and it'll be fine and be communicative that's it and then of course calm down let's hang out let's see what you're doing i'll sit near you i love seeing what you know i love seeing work that you do yeah i just love it i just love seeing it it's just fascinating me but regardless we're just gonna have some fun you know get to know each other and then we'll we'll run for for years forward and we're going to make a lot of money, bro. Like, like, like, like, you want to go to Monaco? Let's go. Okay. Let's get it. Let's get a go to get it. Italy for, for pasta. Yeah. Buy an island real quick. Exactly. Why not? You want to buy a small island? See, see what's available on the market. Yeah. I'm down. This type. That's what I want to do. Yeah.
