## High-Priority Lead Details

### 🔥 ROBERTAS-001: Affidea (Healthcare)

**Why high-priority:**
- Largest diagnostic imaging network in EU
- Family friend relationship = highest trust
- First lead from Robertas (sets the tone)
- Healthcare vertical expansion opportunity

**Company Profile:**
- **Website:** affidea.com
- **Size:** Largest EU network
- **Geography:** Pan-European
- **Contact:** Chief/Owner/Shareholder Founder ("very professional doctor")

**Opportunity:**
- **Primary use cases:** Patient intake automation, imaging workflow optimization, operational dashboards across network
- **Entry point:** 3-Day MVP ($3K-$5K) - patient intake chatbot or dashboard prototype
- **Expansion potential:** $40K-$100K+ (network-wide rollout, multi-location deployment)
- **Relevant case studies:** Johns Hopkins Vision AI, AI Meeting Summaries, Genomic Processing, Medical Voice AI

**Risk mitigation:**
- Healthcare = heavily regulated (GDPR, medical data privacy) → Lead with compliance messaging
- Decision-making may be slow → Start with non-clinical administrative use case
- Multiple stakeholders → Use family friend relationship to navigate

**Discovery agenda:**
- Current pain points (patient intake? imaging workflow? admin burden?)
- Tech stack and systems
- GDPR/compliance requirements
- Highest-ROI quick win for prototype

**Attribution:** 2026-02-06 (identified) → 24-month window expires 2028-02-06

### 🔥 ROBERTAS-004: Vintage Cash Cow (E-commerce/Tech)

**Why high-priority:**
- €5B valuation (highest value lead)
- Cousin is VP ICT (direct decision-maker)
- Rapid expansion mode (scaling challenges = opportunity)
- Multiple project potential

**Company Profile:**
- **Website:** vintagecashcow.co.uk
- **Valuation:** ~€5 billion
- **Founded:** ~2021-2022 (young, high-growth)
- **Origin:** Lithuania → Now UK-managed
- **Team:** 200 ICT professionals in-house
- **Contact:** Cousin (VP ICT), joined 3 months ago via acquisition

**Opportunity:**
- **Primary use cases:** Customer service AI (24/7 chatbot), seller management automation, product data processing, operational dashboards, outreach & growth
- **Entry point:** 3-Day MVP ($3K-$5K) - customer service chatbot or seller analytics
- **Expansion potential:** $60K-$150K+ (multiple projects over time)
- **Relevant case studies:** AI Outreach Platform, AI Intake Systems (1,000+ conversations/day), Client Analytics

**Strategic positioning:**
- **With 200-person internal team:** Position as complementary (specialized AI, rapid prototyping, overflow capacity), NOT replacement
- Frame as: "We work alongside strong teams like yours for specialized AI projects"

**Risk mitigation:**
- Large internal team may prefer build in-house → Emphasize speed (3 days vs weeks internally) and specialized AI expertise
- Cousin is new (3 months) → Help him look good internally with quick wins
- Fast growth = shifting priorities → Start small, prove value quickly

**Discovery agenda:**
- Growth stage and expansion plans
- Current pain points (customer service volume? seller management? data analytics?)
- How external vendors fit with 200-person team
- Budget and procurement process

**Attribution:** 2026-02-06 (identified) → 24-month window expires 2028-02-06

### 🔥 ROBERTAS-005: Aalto Capital (Private Equity)

**Why high-priority:**
- **Dual value:** Direct service + portfolio company referral channel
- Scandinavian market entry (new geography)
- Robertas's core domain (FinTech = his strongest credibility)
- Long-term relationship potential (not just one-time deal)

**Company Profile:**
- **Website:** aaltocapital.com
- **Industry:** Private equity, venture capital, fintech
- **Geography:** Finland + Scandinavia
- **Structure:** 5 main partners (like law firm model)
- **Contact:** Partner, 12-year colleague with Robertas

**Dual Opportunity:**

**Angle 1: Direct to Aalto**
- Portfolio analytics dashboard, deal flow automation, client relationship management, research assistant AI
- Entry: $3K-$5K MVP → $15K-$50K custom
- Commission: $2.25K-$7.5K

**Angle 2: Portfolio Company Referrals** (strategic focus)
- Introduce Nexrizen to portfolio companies needing AI/automation
- Aalto becomes ongoing referral channel
- Even 3-5 portfolio company engagements = $50K-$200K revenue over time
- Commission still flows to Robertas (original introducer)

**Strategic approach:**
1. Deliver value directly to Aalto first (build trust)
2. After 30 days, ask: "Would any portfolio companies benefit from similar work?"
3. Create long-term referral relationship

**Relevant case studies:**
- CITYROW (Fractional CTO → acquisition) - shows we help portfolio companies succeed
- AI Outreach, Client Analytics (operational tools for Aalto)

**Discovery agenda:**
- Aalto's business model (how do they make money?)
- Current operational pain points
- Portfolio company landscape (how many? what stages? what industries?)
- Interest in both direct service AND portfolio referrals

**Attribution:** 2026-02-06 (identified) → 24-month window expires 2028-02-06

## Standard Leads (Key Details Only)

### ROBERTAS-002: Allianz (HR Department)

**Quick summary:**
- Daughter is Senior Partner in HR (Geneva)
- Allianz overall is "conservative about AI" → Focus ONLY on HR department
- She has autonomy within HR to make decisions
- **Not yet discussed with daughter** (Robertas showing potential, needs to brief her first)

**Use cases:** HR automation (onboarding, employee inquiries chatbot, meeting summarization, document processing)
**Entry:** 3-Day MVP ($3K-$5K)
**Risk:** Even with daughter's autonomy, may face corporate procurement. Also: family relationship = extra care needed.
**Next:** Robertas briefs daughter, gauges interest, then formal intro

---

### ROBERTAS-003: VistaJet (Aviation)

**Quick summary:**
- Family friend, pilot/captain with ICT degree from London university
- Global private jet company (Malta-based, Geneva department)
- Contact has technical background BUT may not be decision-maker for tech purchases

**Use cases:** Customer service AI, booking optimization, operational dashboards, client relationship management
**Entry:** 3-Day MVP ($3K-$5K) → Potential $40K+ custom or Fractional CTO
**Risk:** Will likely need to route to operations/IT leadership (pilot as internal champion)
**Strategy:** Use pilot to identify right decision-maker, leverage Robertas's aviation finance background
