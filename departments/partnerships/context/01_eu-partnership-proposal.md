**NEXRIZEN**

*We don't sell AI. We make it work for your business.*

**EU/EEA Reseller Partnership Proposal**

Prepared for: **Robertas V.P. / BIG GROUP**

Prepared by: Weipeng Zhuo, CEO & Co-Founder, Nexrizen

Date: February 2026

Status: *Pre-meeting briefing document --- for discussion Friday with
Weipeng & Gabriel Perez (CTO)*

**1. About Nexrizen**

Nexrizen is a US-based AI consultancy and rapid development firm that
builds custom software, AI systems, and automation for service
businesses. We are not a typical agency --- every project is led
directly by the founders, with no junior developers and no project
manager middlemen.

We practice what we preach: our own sales pipeline, proposals, and
business operations run entirely on proprietary AI systems we've built
internally. This means faster turnaround, lower overhead, and delivery
speeds that traditional agencies cannot match. When we tell clients we
can build AI that transforms their workflow, we're speaking from daily
experience running our own business this way.

**Founding Team**

**Weipeng Zhuo, PhD (ABD) --- CEO & Co-Founder.** Former data scientist
at Meta. Seven years of research at Georgia Tech (ranked #3 nationally
in engineering). Specializes in AI/ML systems, data science, computer
vision, and translating complex technology into business outcomes.
Background spans genomics (terabyte-scale data processing), biotech
(Genentech), and enterprise ML. Conducts 3--4 client discovery calls
daily, maintaining constant exposure to emerging problem spaces and the
latest AI tooling. AILA conference speaker on AI for law firms and
winner of the AILA Technology Innovation Award.

**Gabriel Perez --- CTO & Co-Founder.** 15+ years in production software
engineering. Computer Science at Georgia Tech (ranked #2 nationally).
Former IBM. Serial entrepreneur who has led two successful exits: served
as CTO of CITYROW through their acquisition by WaterRower (January
2024), and built a SaaS platform that was acquired by Georgia Tech.
Built platforms for Techstars-backed startups. Brings deep experience in
scalable architecture and technical leadership.

**Senior Data Scientists:** Zhimin Gao, PhD and Sol Ah Lee, PhD round
out the technical team, supported by three full-stack engineers and
operational staff.

**Track Record**

50+ production applications shipped. Clients include organizations
affiliated with Meta, Johns Hopkins, Georgia Tech, Emory, AWS, and
Techstars-backed startups.

**Headquarters:** United States \| **Website:** nexrizen.com

**2. Partnership Model: Official Reseller / Authorized Representative**

After our initial conversation, we propose the Reseller / Official
Representative model for our EU/EEA cooperation.

**How It Works**

Robertas and BIG GROUP act as Nexrizen's authorized representative in
EU/EEA markets. The structure is straightforward:

**1. You identify and introduce prospects** from your executive network
--- across fintech, banking, aviation, travel, family offices, and
professional services.

**2. You make the warm introduction** to Nexrizen. You can position us
however fits your relationship (e.g., "a US-based AI engineering team I
work with" or "my technology partner for AI and automation").

**3. Nexrizen handles the technical sale.** We run the discovery call,
scope the project, present the proposal, and close. You are welcome to
participate in calls as appropriate. For most prospects, we deliver a
working prototype after the first discovery call --- before any contract
is signed. This eliminates the trust gap and dramatically accelerates
decision-making for the prospect's internal team.

**4. Nexrizen delivers the work.** All engineering, project management,
and client communication during delivery is handled by our team.

**5. You earn 15% commission** on all revenue collected from clients you
introduce.

**What You Are NOT Responsible For**

Technical scoping or engineering estimates; project delivery or client
management post-sale; support, maintenance, or warranty obligations;
pricing decisions (though your input on EU market positioning is
welcomed).

**What You ARE Responsible For**

Identifying potential clients from your network; making quality
introductions (warm email, call, or meeting); providing market context
where helpful (industry norms, buyer expectations, etc.); representing
Nexrizen professionally and ethically in your markets.

**Why This Works for Your Prospects**

Our sales process is unlike any other development firm. After a single
discovery meeting, we generate a working prototype of the proposed
solution --- a functional application, not a slide deck --- before the
prospect pays a cent. This means the prospect's internal team can see
and interact with something real, rather than debating abstractions. It
collapses the typical weeks-long alignment process into days, and it
demonstrates our capabilities more convincingly than any pitch deck ever
could.

For you as the introducer, this is a powerful dynamic: the prospect sees
immediate, tangible value from day one, which reflects well on your
recommendation and accelerates the path to a signed engagement.

**3. Commission Structure**

  ------------------------ ----------------------------------------------
  **Item**                 **Detail**

  **Commission Rate**      15% of collected revenue

  **Basis**                Paid on cash received from client, not on
                           contract value

  **Payment Timing**       Commission paid within 30 days of Nexrizen
                           receiving client payment

  **Payment Method**       Wire transfer (EUR or USD, your preference)

  **Duration**             Commission applies to the initial engagement
                           AND any follow-on work from the same client
                           within 24 months of introduction

  **Exclusions**           Clients who contact Nexrizen independently
                           (not through your introduction)

  **Minimum Deal Size**    No minimum --- though our typical engagements
                           range from \$3,000 to \$30,000+
  ------------------------ ----------------------------------------------

**Example Scenario**

You introduce a fintech company. They engage Nexrizen for a \$25,000
dashboard project. Upon collecting payment, you earn \$3,750 (15%). Six
months later, the same client returns for a \$15,000 AI automation
project --- you earn another \$2,250. Total earned from one
introduction: \$6,000.

**4. What Nexrizen Builds --- Service & Product Overview**

Our offerings fall into three categories, all of which are relevant to
the EU executive market.

**A. Three-Day MVP / Rapid Prototyping (\$3,000--\$5,000)**

**Website:** threedays.ai

This is our entry-level product, ideal for first engagements. We build a
working custom application --- not a mockup, not a slide deck --- in
three business days.

**Why it matters for your network:** Low-risk entry point. Executives
can test our capabilities with a small budget before committing to
larger projects. As you noted in our conversation, Robertas: "First you
can test one piece of the software, if you like you can order more."
This product exists precisely for that purpose.

**The sales advantage:** This isn't just fast delivery --- it's a
fundamentally different buying experience. Instead of the prospect's
team debating what a solution might look like, they can interact with a
real, working application. This eliminates the visualization gap that
stalls most enterprise technology purchases and builds immediate
confidence in our ability to execute.

**Use cases:** Internal dashboards, workflow automation tools, AI
chatbot prototypes, data analysis applications, client portals.

**B. Custom Software & AI Systems (\$10,000--\$50,000+)**

Our core offering and where the majority of revenue is generated. Full
custom development led by senior engineers.

**Custom Software**

(prospect discovery, personalized messaging at scale). Predictive
analytics and performance scoring systems.

**Data & Infrastructure**

Big data architecture redesign (100x speed improvements, 10x cost
reductions --- proven on Fortune 100 client work). Cloud infrastructure
optimization (AWS, GCP). Database migration and optimization (BigQuery,
distributed computing). Scientific-scale data processing at terabyte
volumes.

**C. Fractional CTO / Strategic Technical Leadership
(\$5,000--\$15,000/month)**

For companies that need ongoing senior technology guidance without
hiring a full-time CTO. Services include technology roadmap and
architecture decisions, development team leadership and process
optimization, vendor evaluation and technical due diligence, and
pre-acquisition technical assessment.

  ---------------- --------------------------------- ---------------------

**7. Territory & Client Handling Protocols**

**Territory**

**Your territory:** EU/EEA countries --- all 27 EU member states plus
EEA countries (Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein) and Switzerland.

**Our direct territory:** United States, with global reach for inbound
inquiries.

**UK and rest-of-world:** To be discussed as the partnership matures.

**Client Attribution**

A client is "yours" if you make the first meaningful introduction
(email, call, or meeting where Nexrizen is introduced to the prospect).
Attribution is confirmed via a simple email from you at time of
introduction (e.g., "introducing you to \[Company X\] / \[Person Y\]").
Attribution holds for 24 months from the date of introduction. If a
prospect contacts us independently and also through you, we will discuss
attribution in good faith.

**Non-Compete / Exclusivity**

This is a non-exclusive arrangement initially --- you are free to
represent other technology providers, and we are free to accept EU
clients from other channels. As volume grows, we are open to discussing
exclusive territory rights for specific verticals or countries. You
agree not to directly compete with Nexrizen by offering identical AI
development services in the EU territory.

**Confidentiality**

Both parties maintain strict confidentiality regarding client
information, pricing, and business terms. No client data is shared with
third parties without written consent. We understand and respect your
banking-industry standards of confidentiality.

**8. Professional & Ethical Framework**

We share your commitment to high ethical standards. Here is how we
operate:

**Transparency:** All pricing is shared with you before it reaches the
client. No hidden fees, no surprise charges. You will always know what
the client is paying and what your commission will be.

**Quality Guarantee:** We demonstrate clear ROI within the first 60 days
of any engagement, or we consider it a failure. Our 3-Day MVP product
exists precisely so that clients can test before committing to larger
investments --- no one is pressured into a large contract.

**No Advance Fees from You:** As discussed, this is a pure success-fee
model. You pay nothing, invest nothing upfront. You earn when we earn.

**Client Treatment:** We treat every introduction with care. Your
reputation with your network is paramount --- we understand that you are
putting your name behind our work, and we take that seriously.

**Communication Standards:** We maintain professional communication at
all times. Founder-level contacts are available for any client concern.
We respond to inquiries within 24 hours during business days.

**AI-Native Operations:** Our internal operations run on the same AI
systems we build for clients. We use proprietary tools that ingest every
meeting, document, and communication to maintain perfect continuity
across projects. This means nothing falls through the cracks, proposals
are generated with full contextual accuracy, and our delivery timelines
reflect genuine AI-augmented efficiency --- not marketing claims.
