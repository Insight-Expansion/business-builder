# Nexrizen EU Collateral Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the marketing materials needed to support Robertas and future EU resellers. The goal is to give him professional, ready-to-share assets that position Nexrizen credibly for European executives.

### Core Messaging (Use Across All Materials)

**Tagline:** "We don't sell AI. We make it work for your business."

**Key Differentiator — Prototype-First Sales:**
After a single discovery meeting, Nexrizen builds a working prototype of the proposed solution — a functional application, not a slide deck — before any contract is signed. This eliminates the trust gap and dramatically accelerates decision-making. For the introducer (Robertas), this means the prospect sees immediate, tangible value from day one, which reflects well on his recommendation.

**AI-Native Operations:**
Nexrizen's own sales pipeline, proposals, and business operations run entirely on proprietary AI systems built internally. This means faster turnaround, lower overhead, and delivery speeds that traditional agencies cannot match.

## Priority 1: Immediate Needs (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 One-Pager: Nexrizen EU Executive Overview
**Format:** PDF, A4 size, print-ready
**Length:** 1 page (front only) or 2 pages (front/back)
**Audience:** C-suite and VP-level executives in EU

**Content Structure:**
- **Header:** Nexrizen logo + tagline ("We don't sell AI. We make it work for your business.")
- **The Problem:** 2-3 sentences on what executives struggle with (admin overhead, slow response times, scaling without proportional headcount)
- **What We Build:** Three columns — Custom Software | AI & Automation | Fractional CTO
- **Why We're Different:** 
  - Senior engineers only, founder-led, 50+ apps shipped
  - AI-native operations: we run our own business on proprietary AI systems
  - **Prototype-first sales:** After one discovery call, we build a working prototype before any contract. Not a slide deck — a functional application you can interact with.
- **Proof Points:** 3-4 key metrics (100x speed improvement, 1,300 hours saved, 10x cost reduction, 99% time reduction)
- **Entry Point:** "Start with a discovery call — see a working prototype before you commit"
- **Contact:** Website, email, QR code to booking page

**Design Notes:**
- Clean, minimal European aesthetic (not loud American marketing)
- Subtle color palette — navy, white, light accent
- No stock photos — use abstract data visualization or clean iconography

**Versions Needed:**
- English (primary)
- Consider: French, German (future, if volume justifies)

## Success Metrics

Track collateral effectiveness through:

1. **Usage:** Which materials does Robertas actually send?
2. **Feedback:** What questions do prospects ask after receiving materials?
3. **Conversion:** Do deals progress after materials are shared?

Review after 3 months and iterate based on learnings.
