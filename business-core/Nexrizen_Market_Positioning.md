## Messaging Guidelines

### When Positioning Nexrizen:

**Lead with:**
1. Senior engineering credentials (ex-Meta, ex-IBM, PhDs)
2. Proven production systems (50+ apps, 7K users, $500K+ revenue)
3. Boutique quality (no PMs, no juniors, no handoffs)
4. Industry expertise (legal tech, immigration)

**Avoid:**
- Positioning as "cheap" or "offshore"
- Competing on price alone
- Broad generalist messaging
- Emphasizing team size (small is a feature, not a weakness)

**Target Buyer Persona:**
- Values quality over cost
- Needs strategic technical partner, not just implementation
- Understands AI/automation opportunity
- In professional services (especially legal)
- Burned by previous dev shops or offshore teams

---

## Strategic Positioning Gaps

### What's NOT on Website (But May Be Important)

1. **Pricing transparency** - No pricing ranges or models mentioned
2. **Case studies** - Proof points exist but no detailed case studies published
3. **Process/methodology** - How Nexrizen works isn't documented
4. **Team size** - Full team count not specified
5. **ThreeDays.ai clarity** - Secondary brand poorly defined
6. **Specific technology stack** - Frameworks/tools not listed
7. **Client testimonials** - No quotes or reviews visible

**Recommendation:** Build out these elements to strengthen positioning and conversion.

---

## Competitive Intelligence Needs

To refine positioning, gather data on:
- Competitor pricing models (hourly, fixed, retainer)
- Typical delivery timelines in legal tech space
- How other boutique dev shops position quality vs scale
- Win/loss reasons against specific competitors

---

## Next Actions for Market Positioning

1. **Case studies** - Publish detailed success stories for each service offering
2. **Process documentation** - Show how Nexrizen delivers (methodology page)
3. **Clarify ThreeDays.ai** - Define relationship between brands
4. **Testimonials** - Add client quotes to website
5. **Pricing guidance** - Consider adding starting prices or price ranges
6. **Stack transparency** - List technologies to attract right clients
7. **Blog frequency** - Increase thought leadership content (currently sparse)
