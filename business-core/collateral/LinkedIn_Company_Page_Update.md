# LinkedIn Company Page — Full Update Package

## 🔘 Decision 1: Page Name

LinkedIn URL is `/company/nexrizen-ai/` but the display name is just "Nexrizen".

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **A: Nexrizen** | Clean, short, matches website domain | Doesn't signal AI focus in name |
| **B: Nexrizen AI** | Matches URL, immediately signals AI capability, better for search | Slightly longer, may need website alignment |
| **C: Nexrizen — AI Systems & Custom Software** | Most descriptive, maximizes LinkedIn search surface | Long, might look cluttered |

**Recommendation:** B — it matches the URL you already have and signals AI without being wordy.

## 🔘 Decision 2: About Section Tone

Two directions for the About section. Both contain the same proof points — the difference is voice.

### Option A: Outcome-Led (Professional, Third Person)

```
Nexrizen builds AI systems and custom software that generate real revenue for clients — not prototypes that sit on a shelf.

What makes us different:

→ We build working demos before you pay us anything. 90% of prospects who see a demo respond. 75-80% become clients. No other dev shop does this.

→ We run our entire business on 6 proprietary AI systems — sales automation, rapid prototyping, development acceleration, browser automation, marketing, and operations. We don't just talk about AI. We ship with it daily.

→ Our team is ex-Meta, ex-IBM, and Georgia Tech PhDs. Two founders with 15+ years each. A patent holder with multiple exits. Senior engineers only — no PMs, no junior devs, no offshore teams, no handoffs.

Results in production:
• 50+ applications shipped
• 7,000+ users scaled on a single platform
• 1,000+ AI-powered conversations handled daily
• $500K+ in revenue generated for client systems
• AILA Technology Innovation Award winner
• Fractional CTO at the largest immigration law firm in Dallas

We deliver in 3-12 weeks what traditional agencies take 6 months to build.

Specialties: AI Systems, Custom Software, Legal Tech, Automation, Integrations, Fractional CTO, Rapid Prototyping
```

### Option B: Founder Voice (Direct, First Person, Personality)

```
We're two engineers who got tired of watching agencies charge $50K for work that should take 3 weeks.

So we built Nexrizen — and then we built 6 AI systems to run Nexrizen. Our Proposal Builder generates working demos before clients pay us a cent. Our dev toolkit lets us ship in 3-12 weeks what other shops quote 6 months for. We're not just building AI for clients — we're running on it.

The result: 90% response rate on outreach (industry average is 5-10%). 75-80% of people who see our demos become clients.

Who we are:
→ Wei — ex-Meta data scientist, Georgia Tech PhD, fractional CTO at Dallas's largest immigration law firm, AILA Innovation Award winner
→ Gabe — ex-IBM, Georgia Tech MS CS, patent holder, 2 startup exits, relocating to Spain for EU expansion

What we've shipped:
• 50+ production apps
• 7,000+ users on one platform
• 1,000+ daily AI conversations in production
• $500K+ revenue generated for clients

No PMs. No junior devs. No offshore. No bullshit.

We also don't work with assholes — life's too short and the work is too important.

If you want a fractional AI team that actually builds things: help@nexrizen.com
```

**Recommendation:** Option B is more differentiated and memorable, but Option A is safer for enterprise/EU prospects (Robertas's network). If you want to split the difference, use B's structure with A's tone — or use B and let the website/one-pagers carry the institutional voice.

## 🔘 Decision 3: Specialties Tags

LinkedIn allows up to 20 specialties. Pick the set that matches your current go-to-market:

### Option A: Broad (Cast Wide Net)

```
AI Systems, Custom Software Development, Automation, Integrations,
Machine Learning, Data Engineering, Full-Stack Development,
Rapid Prototyping, Fractional CTO, API Development
```

### Option B: Vertical-Specific (Signal Expertise)

```
AI Systems, Legal Tech, Immigration Law Technology, Custom Software,
Automation, Fractional CTO, Rapid Prototyping, AI Consulting,
Multi-Agent Systems, Production AI Deployment
```

### Option C: Outcome-Focused (Attract Buyers, Not Browsers)

```
AI-Powered Automation, Custom Business Applications, Legal Tech,
Rapid MVP Development, AI Consulting, Production AI Systems,
Fractional CTO Services, Process Automation, Data Infrastructure,
AI Integration
```

**Recommendation:** C — it speaks the language prospects search for ("AI-Powered Automation" vs just "Automation").

---

## Tagline Update

**Current:**
> Custom apps, AI systems, and integrations architected and shipped by ex-Meta and ex-IBM engineers

**Proposed:**
> AI systems and custom software shipped in weeks, not months — by ex-Meta & Georgia Tech PhD engineers

**Why:** Adds the speed differentiator and Georgia Tech (stronger signal than IBM for AI credibility). Keeps it under LinkedIn's 120-character limit.

## Pinned Post

Create and pin ONE post that does the heavy lifting. Draft below:

---

**Post: "Why 90% of Prospects Respond to Our Proposals"**

```
Most dev shops send proposals. We send working demos.

Before you pay us anything, we build a functional prototype
of your project and host it on our demo server.

Here's what happened:
→ 90% response rate (industry average: 5-10%)
→ 75-80% of people who see a demo become clients
→ 10 projects completed in our first month, 12 more in the waitlist

How? We built 6 internal AI systems that let a team of 8
deliver like a team of 20:

1. Proposal Builder — generates proposals 20-30x faster
2. Prototype Generator — working UI from a single prompt
3. Dev Toolkit — why we ship in 3-12 weeks vs 6 months
4. Browser Automation — project-specific test automation
5. Webinar Generator — scales marketing without scaling team
6. Business Builder — AI-native operations (in development)

We don't just build AI for clients.
We run our entire business on it.

If you're evaluating dev partners and want to see what
"AI-native" actually looks like — DM me or visit nexrizen.com

## Content Strategy (Ongoing)

Replace the current repost-heavy feed with a mix:

| Content Type | Frequency | Example Topics |
|---|---|---|
| **Client results / case studies** | 2x/month | "How we built X in 3 weeks", before/after transformations |
| **Behind the scenes / AI-native ops** | 2x/month | "How Proposal Builder works", "Our Claude Code workflow" |
| **Thought leadership** | 1x/week | AI adoption in legal, why agencies are changing, greenfield vs brownfield |
| **Personal / values** | 2x/month | Meditation + clarity, "we don't work with assholes", bootstrap philosophy |
| **Reposts with commentary** | 1x/week max | Add original take, don't just hit repost |

**Rule:** Every post should include at least ONE specific number or result. No vague "AI is transforming business" posts.
