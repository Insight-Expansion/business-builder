# Nexrizen Executive Overview

**Tagline:** We don't sell AI. We make it work for your business.

**Positioning:** Your Fractional AI & Technology Team — senior engineers on demand, no long-term commitment.

---

## The Challenge

Your teams are drowning in manual work. Customer inquiries go unanswered for hours. Data sits in disconnected systems. Scaling means adding headcount proportionally to growth — a model that doesn't scale.

Traditional consultancies deliver slide decks. Implementation takes months. By the time the system is built, your requirements have changed.

**The real cost isn't the consultancy fee — it's the months of lost productivity while you wait.**

---

## What We Build — Outcomes, Not Features

### Custom Software Development
- **Before:** Teams manually pulling reports from 5 systems. **After:** Real-time operational dashboard, one screen, auto-updated.
- Database architecture for terabyte-scale data processing
- Client-facing platforms and portals
- Integration systems connecting fragmented data sources

**Technology:** Python, TypeScript, React, PostgreSQL, Google Cloud Platform

### AI & Automation Systems
- **Before:** 8-person team handling customer inquiries, 4-hour response time. **After:** AI handles 1,000+ conversations daily, instant response, 24/7.
- **Before:** Attorneys spend 1,300 hours/year summarizing meetings. **After:** AI generates summaries in seconds.
- Document processing systems (contracts, invoices, intake forms)
- Intelligent workflow automation (3-5 hours daily of manual work eliminated)

**Proven At:** Johns Hopkins (AI diagnostics), Fortune 100 financial institutions, immigration law firms, real estate investors, professional services firms

### Fractional CTO / Technology Leadership
- Technology strategy and roadmap development
- Technical due diligence for acquisitions
- Engineering team leadership and mentoring
- Architecture review and technical debt management

**Track Record:** Led companies through successful acquisitions (CITYROW acquired by WaterRower, SaaS platform acquired by Georgia Tech)

## Why Nexrizen Is Different

### Senior Engineers Only. Founder-Led Projects.
Every project is led directly by our founders — not delegated to junior developers or offshore teams. Our team of 8 senior engineers brings 100+ years of combined experience. Weipeng Zhuo (CEO, ex-Meta data scientist, Georgia Tech PhD work) and Gabriel Perez (CTO, 15+ years engineering, ex-IBM, Georgia Tech Computer Science) are hands-on with every engagement.

**Result:** No miscommunication. No layers between you and the people doing the work. Senior-level expertise at every stage.

### AI-Native Operations (6 Proprietary Systems)
We run our own business entirely on 6 proprietary AI systems we built internally. Our sales pipeline, client proposals, prototyping, development, marketing, and operations — all powered by AI we built ourselves. What used to take 5-10 hours per proposal now takes less than 1 hour (20-30x time reduction).

Traditional consultancies sell labor at 30-40% margins. AI-native firms like Nexrizen use AI internally to deliver finished outcomes at dramatically higher efficiency — and pass the savings to clients through faster delivery and lower costs. We have an 18+ month head start building and integrating these systems.

**Result:** Faster turnaround times, lower overhead, delivery speeds traditional agencies cannot match. We pass these efficiency gains directly to you through our hourly model — you pay only for the hours used.

### Prototype-First Sales Process
After a single discovery conversation, we build a working prototype of the proposed solution — **before any contract is signed**. Not a slide deck. Not a proposal document. A functional application your team can interact with.

This approach delivers a 90% response rate and 75-80% conversion to paying clients. No other agency does this.

**Result:** You see exactly what you're getting. No visualization gap. No trust issues. Dramatically faster decision-making.
