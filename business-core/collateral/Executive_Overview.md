# Nexrizen Executive Overview

**Tagline:** We don't sell AI. We make it work for your business.

---

## The Challenge

Your teams are drowning in manual work. Customer inquiries go unanswered for hours. Data sits in disconnected systems. Scaling requires adding headcount proportionally to growth.

Traditional consultancies deliver slide decks. Implementation takes months. By the time the system is built, your requirements have changed.

---

## What We Build

### Custom Software Development
- Operational dashboards that surface real-time insights
- Database architecture for terabyte-scale data processing
- Client-facing platforms and portals
- Integration systems connecting fragmented data sources

**Technology:** Python, TypeScript, React, PostgreSQL, Google Cloud Platform

### AI & Automation Systems
- AI chatbots handling customer service 24/7 (1,000+ daily conversations)
- Document processing systems (contracts, invoices, intake forms)
- Meeting transcription and summarization (1,300 attorney hours saved annually)
- Intelligent workflow automation (probate lead generation: 3-5 hours daily eliminated)

**Proven At:** Johns Hopkins (AI diagnostics), Fortune 100 financial institutions, immigration law firms, real estate investors, professional services firms

### Fractional CTO Services
- Technology strategy and roadmap development
- Technical due diligence for acquisitions

## Why Nexrizen Is Different

### Senior Engineers Only. Founder-Led Projects.
Every project is led directly by our founders — not delegated to junior developers or offshore teams. Our team of 8 senior engineers brings 100+ years of combined experience. Weipeng Zhuo (CEO, ex-Meta data scientist, Georgia Tech PhD work) and Gabriel Perez (CTO, 15+ years engineering, ex-IBM, Georgia Tech Computer Science) are hands-on with every engagement.

**Result:** No miscommunication. No layers between you and the people doing the work. Senior-level expertise at every stage.

### AI-Native Operations
We run our own business entirely on proprietary AI systems we built internally. Our sales pipeline, client proposals, project management — all automated with AI. What used to take 5-10 hours per proposal now takes less than 1 hour (20-30x time reduction).

**Result:** Faster turnaround times, lower overhead, delivery speeds traditional agencies cannot match. We pass these efficiency gains directly to our clients.

### Prototype-First Sales Process
After a single discovery conversation, we build a working prototype of the proposed solution — **before any contract is signed**. Not a slide deck. Not a proposal document. A functional application your team can interact with.

This approach delivers a 90% response rate and 75-80% conversion to paying clients. No other agency does this.

**Result:** You see exactly what you're getting. No visualization gap. No trust issues. Dramatically faster decision-making.
