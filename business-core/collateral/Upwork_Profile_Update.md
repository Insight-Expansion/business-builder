# Upwork Profile — Full Update Package

## Current Profile Snapshot

| Field | Current Value | Issue |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| **Name** | Weipeng Z. | Fine |
| **Title** | Ex-Meta \| PhD (ABD) \| AI Startup Founder \| Expert-Vetted | Decent but doesn't mention the firm or delivery model |
| **Rate** | $120/hr | Aligned with pricing policy |
| **Job Success** | 100% | Excellent — protect this |
| **Expert-Vetted** | Yes (Top 1%) | Huge trust signal — use more prominently |
| **Total earnings** | $10K+ | Low — might concern larger clients |
| **Total jobs** | 11 | Low volume |
| **Hours** | 47 | Very low — signals light usage |
| **Agency** | Insight Expansion | Not Nexrizen |
| **Availability** | Less than 30 hrs/week | Signals part-time |
| **Employment** | "Facebook — August 2022 - Present" | Stale — you left Meta |

---

## Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)

### 1. Employment History Says "Facebook — Present"

You're listed as currently employed at Facebook/Meta. This is inaccurate and could raise trust issues. Update end date and add Nexrizen/Insight Expansion as current role.

**Fix:**
- Facebook → change to "August 2022 - [Actual End Date]"
- Add: "CEO & Co-Founder | Nexrizen" as current position

### 2. Agency Association Says "Insight Expansion" Not "Nexrizen"

Prospects clicking through see "Insight Expansion" — no mention of Nexrizen anywhere. If Nexrizen is the client-facing brand, the agency profile should reflect that (or at minimum the bio should bridge the gap).

### 3. Availability Says "Less than 30 hrs/week"

For a profile selling a team's services at $120/hr, this signals part-time freelancer, not an agency with capacity. Change to "More than 30 hrs/week" or "As needed - open to offers" depending on what Upwork allows.

---

## 🔘 Decision 1: Profile Positioning

The fundamental question: is this profile positioned as **Wei the individual freelancer** or **Wei representing Nexrizen the firm**?

Currently it straddles both — "My team and I" in the bio, but everything else reads solo.

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **A: Solo Expert** (status quo with polish) | Upwork rewards individual credibility, Expert-Vetted is personal, clients on Upwork often prefer dealing with one person | Undersells team capacity, limits project size, doesn't leverage Nexrizen's full stack |
| **B: Expert-Led Team** (recommended) | Honest about how you deliver, justifies $120/hr, opens door to bigger projects, matches actual workflow | Some Upwork clients prefer solo freelancers, might lose "scrappy individual" appeal |
| **C: Full Agency Profile** | Most accurate representation, showcases all 8 team members | Upwork agency profiles get less traffic than individual profiles, loses Expert-Vetted badge visibility |

**Recommendation:** B — Lead as Wei (the Expert-Vetted individual with Meta/PhD credentials) but make it clear you have a senior team behind you. Best of both worlds. The Expert-Vetted badge is on YOUR profile — use it as the entry point, then sell the team's capacity.

---

## 🔘 Decision 2: Profile Focus — Data Science vs Full-Stack AI Agency

The current profile is 100% data science / ML / data engineering. But Nexrizen's actual bread and butter is **custom software + AI systems** — apps, dashboards, chatbots, automation.

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **A: Keep Data Science Focus** | Matches existing reviews and portfolio, Expert-Vetted likely evaluated on this | Doesn't attract the $5K-$30K custom app projects that are your real business |
| **B: Pivot to AI Systems + Custom Software** (recommended) | Matches actual service delivery, attracts higher-value projects, differentiates from commodity data scientists | Mismatch with existing portfolio items (need to add new ones) |
| **C: Hybrid — AI Solutions (Data Science + Software)** | Casts wider net, honestly represents range | Dilutes positioning, "jack of all trades" risk |

**Recommendation:** B — The $3K-$10K custom software projects are where the volume is. Data science gigs on Upwork tend to be smaller and more commodity. Lead with AI systems and custom software, mention data science as a supporting capability.

---

## 🔘 Decision 3: Bio Tone

### Option A: Credential-Led (Polished, Professional)

```
Top 1% Upwork Expert-Vetted | Ex-Meta Senior Data Scientist | PhD (ABD) Georgia Tech

I lead a team of 8 senior engineers (ex-Meta, ex-IBM, Georgia Tech PhDs) who build
AI systems and custom software in 3-12 weeks — not months.

What makes us different: We build a working prototype of your project before you
pay us anything. 90% of clients who see a demo move forward.

What we build:
→ AI-powered automation (chatbots, document processing, lead routing, multi-agent systems)
→ Custom web applications (dashboards, portals, internal tools)
→ Data infrastructure (pipelines, analytics, ML models)
→ Voice AI & conversational systems (1,000+ daily conversations in production)

Results:
• 50+ production applications shipped
• 7,000+ users scaled on a single platform
• $500K+ in revenue generated for client systems
• AILA Technology Innovation Award winner
• Fractional CTO at the largest immigration law firm in Dallas

Our proprietary AI development toolkit lets us deliver at speeds that surprise
even technical buyers. We've completed 10 projects in a single month with 12
more in the waitlist.

Best fit: Startups and SMBs who need production-quality AI systems or custom
software built fast by senior engineers. Greenfield projects are our sweet spot.

Tech stack: Python, React, Next.js, Node.js, GCP, AWS, Claude/Anthropic,
OpenAI, LangChain, RAG, vector databases, fine-tuning, multi-agent orchestration.

Book a call → we'll show you a working demo of your idea before you commit.
```

### Option B: Direct & Personal (Founder Voice)

```
Top 1% Upwork Expert-Vetted | Ex-Meta | PhD (ABD) Georgia Tech

Here's what we do differently: Before you pay us anything, we build a working
prototype of your project. 90% of clients who see it move forward. No other
dev shop on Upwork does this.

I'm Wei — I lead a team of 8 senior engineers (ex-Meta, ex-IBM, Georgia Tech PhDs).
We build AI systems and custom software in 3-12 weeks. We've shipped 50+ production
apps, scaled platforms to 7,000+ users, and generated $500K+ in revenue for clients.

How? We built 6 internal AI systems that let a team of 8 deliver like a team of 20.
Our Proposal Builder alone generates proposals 20-30x faster than doing it manually.
Our dev toolkit is why we ship in weeks, not months.

What we build:
→ AI automation (chatbots, multi-agent systems, document processing, lead routing)
→ Custom apps (dashboards, portals, internal tools, MVPs)
→ Voice AI (1,000+ daily conversations in production for one client alone)
→ Data infrastructure & ML (pipelines, models, analytics)

No PMs. No junior devs. No offshore. Senior engineers only.

Best for: Startups and SMBs who want production-quality AI or custom software
built fast. Greenfield is our sweet spot — we build from scratch faster than
most teams can integrate with your legacy code.

Send me your project description. I'll send back a working demo.
```

**Recommendation:** A is safer for the Upwork audience (professional, credential-forward). B is more memorable but may turn off conservative enterprise buyers who browse Upwork. A also front-loads the Expert-Vetted / Meta / PhD signals which is what makes Upwork clients stop scrolling.

---

## 🔘 Decision 4: Title/Headline

The title is the first thing people see in search results. Currently:

> Ex-Meta | PhD (ABD) | AI Startup Founder | Expert-Vetted

Options:

| Option | Title | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| **A** | Ex-Meta \| AI Systems & Custom Software \| 50+ Apps Shipped \| Expert-Vetted | Leads with credential + what you build + proof |
| **B** | AI Agency Founder \| Ex-Meta \| We Build Your Demo Before You Pay \| Expert-Vetted | Differentiator-led, most unique |
| **C** | Ex-Meta Senior Data Scientist \| PhD (ABD) \| AI & Custom Software \| Expert-Vetted | Closest to current, adds software |
| **D** | Ex-Meta \| PhD \| AI Systems in 3-12 Weeks \| 100% Job Success \| Expert-Vetted | Speed + trust signals |

**Recommendation:** A — "50+ Apps Shipped" is a concrete proof point that no other freelancer on Upwork can match. It immediately separates you from the "I know Python and ML" crowd.

## Skills List Update

**Current skills** (data science heavy):
Python, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Engineering, Chatbot, Distributed Computing, Generative AI, LangChain, LLM Prompt, ChatGPT, OpenAI API

**Proposed skills** (aligned with actual service delivery):

| Keep | Add | Remove |
|------|-----|--------|
| Python | **Claude / Anthropic API** | ~~LLM Prompt~~ (vague) |
| Machine Learning | **React / Next.js** | ~~ChatGPT~~ (commodity signal) |
| Generative AI | **Full-Stack Development** | |
| Data Science | **AI Agent Development** | |
| Data Engineering | **Custom Software Development** | |
| Chatbot | **API Integration** | |
| LangChain | **RAG (keep)** | |
| Computer Vision | **GCP / Cloud Architecture** | |
| OpenAI API | **Web Application** | |
| | **AI Automation** | |

**Why:** Current skills list says "I'm a data scientist." Updated list says "I build AI-powered software." The latter attracts higher-value projects.

---

## Portfolio Update

### Current Portfolio (6 items — all data science)

1. Vision AI Medical Research (Johns Hopkins)
2. Large Scale Automated AI Outreach
3. Advanced AI Chatbot
4. Advertising Performance Score System
5. Medical Residency Exam Prep Analytics
6. Scalable Genomic Processing

### Problem

Zero portfolio items show custom software, web apps, dashboards, or production AI systems. A client looking for "build me an app" sees only academic data science.

### Recommended Additions (pick 3-4)

| Portfolio Item | Why Include | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **AI Intake System — 1,000 Leads/Day** | Most impressive production scale, legal tech proof | Immigration law firm work |
| **Live AI Coaching System (GoldPro/Construction)** | Shows vertical depth, unique use case | Israel engagement |
| **Voice AI System — 1,000+ Daily Conversations** | Production AI at scale | Existing client |
| **Custom Dashboard — Saenz-Garcia Law** | Shows full-stack capability, named client | Fractional CTO work |
| **Multi-Agent Orchestration System** | Shows cutting-edge AI architecture | Thomas engagement |
| **Peer Feedback Platform — 7,000+ Users** | Proves team can scale (Gabe's project, but shows team capability) | Georgia Tech |

### Items to Consider Removing

- **Scalable Genomic Processing** — impressive but irrelevant to target clients
- **Medical Residency Exam Prep** — too academic, not aligned with current services

Keep the Johns Hopkins Vision AI piece — it's a credibility anchor.

## Employment History Update

### Current (Stale)

| Role | Company | Dates | Issue |
|------|---------|-------|-------|
| Data Scientist | Facebook | Aug 2022 - Present | **Wrong — you left Meta** |
| Senior Data Engineer | OMNY Health | Jul 2021 - Jul 2022 | Fine |
| Data Science Fellow | Data Incubator | Sep 2020 - Jan 2021 | Fine but old |
| Lead Data Scientist | Girihlet Inc. | Aug 2020 - Jun 2021 | Fine but old |
| Leadership Coach | Georgia Tech | 2014-2018 | Irrelevant to buyers |
| Graduate RA | Georgia Tech | 2012-2019 | Irrelevant to buyers |
| Lead Tutor | C2 Education | 2012 | Irrelevant |
| Undergrad Research | UMBC | 2009-2012 | Irrelevant |

### Recommended Update

| Action | Role | Company | Dates |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| **Add** | CEO & Co-Founder | Nexrizen | 2025 - Present |
| **Add** | Fractional CTO | Saenz-Garcia Law | [Start] - Present |
| **Add** | Founder | Insight Expansion | [Start] - Present |
| **Fix** | Data Scientist | Meta (Facebook) | Aug 2022 - [Actual End] |
| **Keep** | Senior Data Engineer | OMNY Health | As-is |
| **Keep** | Lead Data Scientist | Girihlet Inc. | As-is |
| **Consider removing** | Leadership Coach, Tutor, Undergrad | — | Adds noise, no buyer relevance |

---

## Education Update

### Current
- UMBC — BS Chemical Engineering
- Georgia Tech — PhD Chemical Engineering
- Data Incubator — Data Science Bootcamp

### Note
PhD is listed without "(ABD)" — title says ABD but education section implies completed. Make sure this is consistent. Georgia Tech #3 engineering school is a strong signal — consider adding a description line like "AI/ML integrated research" to signal relevance.

---

## Testimonial

### Current
One testimonial from Hannah N. (Sep 2022) about proposal strategy work — not about AI or software.

### Recommended
Solicit testimonials from:
1. A client from a recent AI/software project (strongest signal)
2. The Saenz-Garcia Law engagement (legal tech proof)
3. Any client with "name recognition" value

Even one testimonial about AI systems or custom software delivery would dramatically strengthen the profile.

---

## Other Quick Fixes

| Field | Current | Recommended |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Video introduction** | None | Record a 60-second video: credentials, what you build, team, "demo before you pay" pitch. Profiles with video get 2x more invitations on Upwork |
| **Hours per week** | Less than 30 | "More than 30 hrs/week" (you have a team) |
| **Languages** | English (Native), Chinese (Conversational) | Keep as-is |
| **Consultations** | Not set up | Set up — free 15-min or paid 30-min at $120/hr. Low-friction entry point |
| **Certifications** | None | Add any relevant: GCP, AWS, or Anthropic/OpenAI certs if available |
| **Project catalog** | Empty | Create 2-3 productized offerings (e.g., "AI Chatbot MVP — 3 weeks", "Custom Dashboard — 2 weeks", "Voice AI System — Quote") |

## Risk: Protecting 100% Job Success

The 100% Job Success score is extremely valuable — it's one of your strongest conversion signals on the platform. Any profile changes should NOT:

- Attract misaligned clients (e.g., $500 data cleaning gigs)
- Overpromise and underdeliver on timelines
- Shift positioning so far that existing clients feel misled

The proposed changes should actually **improve** client fit by attracting the right projects (custom AI/software, $3K+) and filtering out the wrong ones (cheap data tasks).

---

*The Upwork profile is currently your #1 revenue channel (~70%) with a ~50% close rate on warm leads. These updates align the profile with how Nexrizen actually operates and what you actually deliver — closing the gap between the "freelance data scientist" profile and the "AI agency with 50+ shipped apps" reality.*
