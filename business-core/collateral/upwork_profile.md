### Testimonials

Endorsements from past clients

"Weipeng worked with me on creating a proposal for high-impact training initiatives in Ethiopia and the country of Georgia. Wei listened carefully to my proposal goals and challenges before brainstorming proposal strategies with me. He was able to identify and troubleshoot problem areas efficiently and took a collaborative approach that utilized our complementary skillsets and perspectives. What I found particularly helpful is Weipeng's capacity to simplify complex concepts in a combination of verbal and quantitative data visualization. His data visualization skills - combined with a level of communication that is rare among the quantitatively minded - simply outstanding. Weipeng is a joy to work with and makes excellent use of his time on projects. "
