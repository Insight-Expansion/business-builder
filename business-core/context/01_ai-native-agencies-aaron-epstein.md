Agencies have always been crazy hard to scale. Low margins, slow manual work, and the only way to grow is to add more people.

But AI changes this.

Now instead of selling software to customers to help them do the work, you can charge way more by using the software yourself and selling them the finished product at 100x the price.

Think of a design firm that uses AI to produce custom design work for clients upfront, to win the business before the contract is even signed. Or an ad agency that uses AI to create stunning video ads without the time and expense of setting up a physical shoot. Or a law firm that uses AI to write legal docs in minutes, rather than weeks.

That's why agencies of the future will look more like software companies, with software margins. And they'll scale far bigger than any agencies that exist in these fragmented markets today.

If you're rethinking how agencies and service businesses of the future will be built, we'd love to hear from you.
