# Nexrizen Operational Roadmap & Current State

**Wei & Gabriel Perez | February 14, 2026**
**Time horizon: Now through post-retreat (February – June 2026)**

---

## Situation Summary

Nexrizen is an AI consultancy generating revenue through custom software development, primarily for law firms and immigration practices. The business has strong unit economics and high engineer utilization, but is structurally fragile due to near-total dependence on Wei for lead generation and sales. With Wei departing for a 1.5-month silent meditation retreat in 4-6 weeks, the business faces a critical window to transition from founder-dependent sales to sustainable, systemized revenue generation.

The core tension: the business works, but only because Wei is personally powering it 20-30 hours per week. Remove Wei, and the pipeline dries up in the same timeframe as his absence.

## Financial Snapshot

### Monthly Economics

| Line Item | Amount | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Engineer hours available | 240 hrs/mo | Marta (full) + Susanna (20 hrs/wk) |
| Engineer cost rate | $60/hr | Contractor rate |
| Client billing rate | $120/hr | 2x markup |
| **Total monthly burn** | **~$17,400** | 240 × $60 + ~$3K (Ruth, tools, misc) |
| **Revenue at full utilization** | **~$28,800** | 240 × $120 |
| **Gross profit at full utilization** | **~$14,400** | Before founder compensation |
| Current utilization | 85%+ | Strong, but sustained by Wei's sales effort |
| Effective gross profit (current) | ~$12,000-14,000/mo | Variable based on utilization gaps |

### The Margin Problem (Now Resolved)

Fixed-price projects have been the primary margin killer. Multiple projects hit or exceeded budget, meaning Nexrizen delivered work at or below cost once founder time was included. The decision to shift all new work to hourly billing at $120/hr is the most impactful financial decision already made. This alone should stabilize margins going forward.

**Rule going forward:** No fixed-price projects. Period. For existing clients requesting additional scope (e.g., Rob's project at $3,500), push for hourly. If they don't accept hourly terms, don't do the work.

### Personal Runway

Both founders have less than 2 months of personal runway. This creates real pressure and limits the ability to take risks or invest in longer-term initiatives. The hybrid retreat plan (Gabe does light sales + pursues personal income) partially addresses this, but the situation remains tight.

### Cost Reduction Levers (If Needed)

| Lever | Monthly Savings | Impact |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| Pause Susanna (20 hrs/wk) | ~$4,800 | Reduces capacity but preserves core team |
| Pause Ruth (30 hrs/wk VA) | ~$1,200 | Minimal if no active sales happening |
| Both | ~$6,000 | Significant breathing room, agency can still operate with Marta |
| Pause Marta | ~$9,600 | **Last resort** — losing Marta would be far more costly to replace |

**Decision point:** Susanna's hours during retreat should be decided by end of Week 3 based on pipeline visibility. If there isn't enough committed hourly work to keep her utilized at 70%+, pause her hours for the retreat period and bring her back when pipeline recovers.

## The Single Point of Failure

### Wei's Current Sales Workload

| Activity | Hours/Week | Channel | Can Others Do It? |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| Upwork browsing, filtering, applying | 5-8 hrs | Upwork | Partially (Ruth could filter) |
| Proposal building | 5-8 hrs | Upwork | Becoming faster (<1hr each) but requires technical judgment |
| Discovery/sales calls | 5-8 hrs | All channels | Gabe can do some |
| Lead nurturing & follow-up | 3-5 hrs | All channels | Ruth could assist with scheduling |
| LinkedIn content & engagement | 2-3 hrs | LinkedIn | Can continue during retreat (scheduled posts) |
| **Total** | **20-30 hrs/wk** | | |

**The math problem:** Wei spends 80-120 hrs/month on sales to generate ~$12-14K in gross profit. That's an effective rate of $100-175/hr for the business — but for Wei personally, much of that time could be replaced by systems or delegation, freeing him for higher-leverage work.

### Pipeline Buffer

If all lead generation stopped today, current active projects and converting pipeline would sustain the business for approximately 4-6 weeks. This is almost exactly the duration of Wei's retreat, meaning there is essentially zero margin for error.

### What This Means for the Retreat

Without intervention, the most likely scenario is:
- Weeks 1-2 of retreat: existing projects continue, revenue is fine
- Weeks 3-4: projects start completing, no new pipeline to replace them
- Weeks 5-6: utilization drops significantly, revenue declines
- Wei returns to an empty or near-empty pipeline and has to rebuild from scratch

**This scenario must be prevented.** The entire pre-retreat plan is designed around this.

## Revenue Channel Assessment

### Current Active Channels

**Upwork (~70% of revenue)**
- Pros: Proven, consistent deal flow, Wei has strong profile and reviews
- Cons: Entirely manual, entirely Wei-dependent, time-intensive, margins often compressed by fixed-price dynamics, not operational during retreat
- Verdict: Continue at reduced effort through retreat prep, but systematically reduce dependence. Stop taking new Upwork projects that would start after retreat departure.

**LinkedIn Inbound (~20% of revenue)**
- Pros: Growing organically, relatively low-effort, builds brand simultaneously
- Cons: Unpredictable volume, still early-stage, not enough to sustain the business alone
- Verdict: Continue and increase. Content can be scheduled in advance. Gabe can handle inbound inquiries during retreat.

**Referrals / Network (~10% of revenue)**
- Pros: Highest quality leads, lowest acquisition cost, no time investment per lead
- Cons: Unpredictable, can't be "turned on" at will
- Verdict: Actively re-engage existing network before retreat. Every past client, conference contact, and industry connection should hear from Wei in the next 4 weeks.

### Channels Being Activated

**LinkedIn DM + Email Outbound Campaigns**
- Status: Systems already built, just need to be turned on
- Timeline to results: 2-4 weeks to generate qualified conversations
- Retreat-proof: Yes — automated once running, Gabe monitors and responds
- Investment needed: Time to configure sequences, review messaging, optimize targeting
- **Priority: HIGH — this is the most reliable retreat-proof channel because it's automated**

**Paid Ads (Meta / LinkedIn)**
- Status: Not yet started, $500-1K/month budget allocated
- Timeline to results: 4-8 weeks minimum for meaningful data; unlikely to generate revenue before retreat
- Retreat-proof: Yes — can run unattended, Gabe monitors spend
- Investment needed: Ad creative, landing page, targeting setup. Wei's friend with Airbnb B&B ad experience is a resource.
- **Priority: MEDIUM — start now for learning, but don't depend on this for retreat coverage**

**Webinars**
- Status: Just started, early experiments
- Timeline to results: Each webinar can generate immediate conversations + long-tail content
- Retreat-proof: Recorded webinars can be repurposed; live webinars require someone to host (Gabe)
- Investment needed: Topic selection, promotion, recording setup
- **Priority: MEDIUM — do 1-2 before retreat, record them, Gabe can reference/share during retreat**

**School Community**
- Status: Early stage, playing around with it
- Timeline to results: Slow build, not a short-term revenue driver
- Retreat-proof: Community can exist without daily management
- **Priority: LOW for retreat prep, MEDIUM for post-retreat**

### Partnership Channels

**Robertas (EU Reseller)**
- Opportunity: Brings European clients to Nexrizen, earns commission/markup
- Status: Good conversations, needs concrete proposal with defined terms
- 6-week potential: Realistic if terms are proposed this week and agreed within 2 weeks
- What's needed: Clear proposal defining scope of services Nexrizen would deliver, pricing structure, how leads are handed off, payment terms
- Risk: Even if agreed quickly, first actual project may not start before retreat

**Rob (Existing Client → Deeper Partnership)**
- Opportunity: Expand from current project relationship into ongoing retained/partnership arrangement
- Status: Active client, relationship is established, but deeper terms are undefined
- 6-week potential: Realistic — this is the lowest-friction partnership because the relationship already exists
- What's needed: Conversation about what an expanded engagement looks like. Could Rob provide a pipeline of ongoing work at hourly rates that keeps Marta busy during retreat?
- Risk: Rob's budget may not support the volume needed

**Sherrod (O-1 Visa Platform)**
- Status: Exploratory
- 6-week potential: Unlikely to generate revenue in time
- Action: Maintain the relationship, don't invest significant pre-retreat time

**AJ / Jacob**
- Status: Stalled — AJ is enthusiastic but may lack decision-making authority. Jacob appears skeptical.
- 6-week potential: Unlikely
- Action: One follow-up to gauge reality, then deprioritize if no concrete movement

**Dan / Erik (Used Car Dealers)**
- Status: Post-conference connection
- 6-week potential: Very unlikely — and the market analysis (perfect information, compressed margins) suggests limited long-term potential
- Action: Deprioritize

## Pre-Retreat Action Plan

### Weeks 1-2: Activate & Propose (February 14 – February 28)

**Partnerships — Do This First**

- [ ] Draft and send a concrete proposal to Robertas by end of this week. Include: what services Nexrizen provides, pricing/rate structure, lead handoff process, payment terms, and a suggested first project or trial period.
- [ ] Have an expanded partnership conversation with Rob. Ask directly: would you be interested in an ongoing hourly arrangement that provides consistent work through Q2? Propose specific terms.
- [ ] Send one follow-up each to Sherrod and AJ. If either responds with concrete next steps, engage. If not, park them.
- [ ] Set a hard internal deadline: if Robertas and Rob haven't committed to terms by end of Week 3, shift all energy to outbound systems.

**Outbound Systems — Turn Them On**

- [ ] Activate LinkedIn DM campaign sequences. Target: law firm decision makers, legal operations managers, immigration practice owners.
- [ ] Activate email outbound sequences. Use the law firm vertical messaging that emphasizes outcomes (efficiency, never losing consultation details, real-time practice visibility).
- [ ] Configure messaging for hourly engagements, not fixed-price projects. The pitch is fractional AI/tech team, not one-off project delivery.
- [ ] Set volume targets: aim for 5-10 qualified conversations per week within 2 weeks.

**Paid Ads — Plant Seeds**

- [ ] Set up a small Meta or LinkedIn ad campaign ($500 budget for first month).
- [ ] Talk to friend about Facebook ads basics — get their playbook for the Airbnb B&B campaigns.
- [ ] Create a simple landing page or funnel for the ad traffic to hit.
- [ ] Goal is data and learning, not immediate revenue.

**Network Re-Activation**

- [ ] Make a list of every past client, conference contact, and warm connection who could either become a client or refer one.
- [ ] Send personalized outreach to the top 20. Not a sales pitch — a genuine check-in that mentions Nexrizen's current services and availability.
- [ ] Reactivate any old leads that went cold. Some of them may have needs that have grown since they last spoke with Wei.

**Upwork — Continue But Shift**

- [ ] Continue Upwork lead gen at current pace for Weeks 1-2.
- [ ] Be highly selective: only pursue projects that are hourly, $10K+ total value, and can start within 1-2 weeks.
- [ ] Begin documenting the Upwork process for potential handoff (even partial) to Gabe or Ruth.

### Weeks 3-4: Assess & Train (March 1 – March 14)

**Partnership Check-In**

- [ ] Are Robertas and/or Rob committed? If yes: structure the deals explicitly to provide work through April-May. Get this in writing (contract, SOW, or at minimum detailed email agreement).
- [ ] If neither has committed: accept that partnerships won't carry the retreat and double down on outbound + pre-loaded pipeline.

**Outbound Performance Review**

- [ ] How many qualified conversations have the LinkedIn DM and email campaigns generated?
- [ ] Are any converting to actual calls or proposals?
- [ ] Adjust sequences, messaging, and targeting based on first 2 weeks of data.
- [ ] If outbound is generating warm leads, this becomes the primary retreat-proof channel.

**Gabe Training**

- [ ] Begin training Gabe on handling warm inbound leads: how to qualify them, what to say on a first call, how to scope an hourly engagement, how to send a proposal.
- [ ] This is NOT training Gabe to run the full Upwork grind — it's training him to convert leads that come in through automated or partnership channels.
- [ ] Do 2-3 practice runs where Gabe leads a sales conversation with Wei observing.

**Upwork Wind-Down**

- [ ] Stop accepting new Upwork projects that would start after March 15.
- [ ] Focus remaining Upwork effort on closing the 2 good leads Wei has been nurturing.
- [ ] Begin mentally (and practically) decoupling from Upwork as the primary revenue channel.

**Team Decision**

- [ ] Assess pipeline visibility for April-May. Is there enough committed hourly work to keep Marta + Susanna busy?
- [ ] If yes: maintain both through retreat.
- [ ] If not: plan to pause Susanna's hours at retreat start ($4,800/month savings). Communicate this to her with clear expectation of resuming when Wei returns.
- [ ] Ruth decision: if Gabe isn't actively selling during retreat, Ruth's hours may not be needed. Evaluate.

### Weeks 4-6: Handoff & Departure (March 14 – ~March 28)

**Pipeline Pre-Loading**

- [ ] Get every possible project signed and committed before departure. Contracts over handshakes.
- [ ] For any projects in final negotiation, either close them or hand the relationship to Gabe with full context.
- [ ] Identify any clients who might need work in April-May and proactively reach out to schedule it.

**The Gabe Playbook**

Create a single document (or Notion page) that Gabe can reference throughout the retreat:

- [ ] **Active clients:** Who they are, what they're paying, who on the team is assigned, what the current status is, and when the work is expected to complete.
- [ ] **Outbound systems:** How to monitor LinkedIn DM and email campaigns. What metrics to watch. When to adjust. How to respond to positive replies.
- [ ] **Warm leads:** Any open conversations, where they stand, and suggested next steps.
- [ ] **Partnership contacts:** Robertas and Rob status, contact info, what's been agreed, what's pending.
- [ ] **Decision criteria for new work:** What to say yes to (hourly, $120/hr, law firm vertical preferred, can start immediately). What to say no to (fixed-price, under $5K, outside core expertise, requires Wei's involvement).
- [ ] **Emergency contacts:** If something goes wrong with a client or project, who can help (Marta for technical issues, Wei only if truly critical).
- [ ] **Financial guardrails:** Monthly burn, minimum revenue needed to break even, when to trigger cost reduction (pause Susanna/Ruth).

**Automated Systems Checklist**

Before departing, confirm all of the following are running:

- [ ] LinkedIn DM campaigns active and generating responses
- [ ] Email outbound sequences active
- [ ] LinkedIn content scheduled for at least 2-3 weeks (or Gabe takes over posting)
- [ ] Ad campaigns running (if started) with budget caps set
- [ ] Gabe has access to all relevant accounts, tools, and dashboards

**Personal Preparation**

- [ ] Ensure personal finances can sustain through the retreat + 2 weeks buffer after return.
- [ ] Communicate retreat to active clients. Let them know Gabe is the point of contact. Reassure them that delivery continues as normal (Marta handles technical execution).
- [ ] Set clear boundaries: truly silent retreat, or will there be a weekly 30-minute check-in with Gabe?

## During Retreat: Gabe's Operating Plan

### Weekly Rhythm

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Monday | Review outbound campaign metrics. Respond to any warm leads. Check in with Marta/Susanna on active projects. |
| Tuesday-Thursday | Handle client communications. Take sales calls if leads come in. Work on personal income (FCTO gig, contract work). |
| Friday | Weekly status update (even if just to himself). Review financials: are we on track, do we need to cut costs? |

### Decision Framework for Gabe

**Accept new work if:**
- It's hourly at $120/hr or above
- It can be scoped and delivered by Marta (and Susanna if retained) without Wei
- The client understands Wei is unavailable and is okay working with Gabe as project lead
- Total commitment doesn't exceed available engineering hours

**Decline or defer if:**
- It's fixed-price
- It requires Wei's specific expertise or involvement
- The client wants to start immediately but scope is unclear
- It would overcommit the engineering team

**Escalate (contact Wei only if):**
- A major client threatens to leave
- A financial emergency (burn exceeding revenue by more than $5K in a single month)
- A partnership opportunity too significant to defer (e.g., Robertas brings a $50K+ deal)

### Minimum Viable Revenue Target During Retreat

To break even with reduced team (assuming Susanna is paused):

| Item | Monthly |
|------|---------|
| Marta (full time) | ~$9,600 |
| Ruth (if retained) | ~$1,200 |
| Other expenses | ~$1,800 |
| **Total burn** | **~$12,600** |
| **Required billable hours (Marta)** | **~105 hrs/mo at $120/hr** |
| **Marta utilization needed** | **~65%** |

This is achievable if there are 1-2 active hourly projects running. The pre-loading phase should aim to have at least this much committed work in place.

## Post-Retreat Priorities (May – June 2026)

### Week 1 Back: Assessment

- Review what happened during retreat: revenue, pipeline, team status, client relationships
- Debrief with Gabe: what worked, what didn't, what surprised him
- Assess which channels generated leads and revenue while Wei was gone
- Restart outbound activity if it slowed during retreat

### Weeks 2-4: Stabilize & Build

- Re-engage any leads or partnerships that stalled during retreat
- Begin building the first Claude Code plugin for law firm vertical using workflows already developed for existing clients
- Target: have a sellable product within 2-3 weeks of focused effort
- Test-sell to existing contacts: webinar audience, school community, past law firm clients

### Weeks 4-8: Test & Scale

- If organic sales generate 5-10 unit sales at $1-2K: the product has signal. Begin investing ad budget to scale.
- Evaluate AILA Texas Fall Conference as a distribution and networking event
- Consider Chicago workshop with Tarim as a combined teaching + product development opportunity
- Double down on the 1-2 marketing channels that performed best during retreat, begin deprioritizing underperformers

### Success Metrics to Track

| Metric | Current | Target (Post-Retreat) | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------|----------------------|----------------|
| Revenue from non-Upwork channels | ~30% | 60%+ | Reduces founder dependence |
| Wei's weekly sales hours | 20-30 hrs | 10-15 hrs | Frees time for product development |
| Engineer utilization | 85%+ | 80%+ | Maintain while transitioning channels |
| Plugin/info product revenue | $0 | $5-10K | Validates the scalable model |
| Monthly gross profit | ~$12-14K | $15K+ | Supports founder compensation |
| Personal monthly draw (each founder) | $0 | $3K+ | Basic financial stability |

---

## Key Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Pipeline dries up during retreat | Medium-High | Critical | Pre-load pipeline, activate automated outbound, close partnership deals before departure |
| Partnerships don't close in time | Medium | High | Don't depend on partnerships alone; automated outbound is the reliable backup |
| Gabe can't convert warm leads to revenue | Medium | High | Train him in Weeks 3-4, do practice runs, keep the close simple (hourly, standard rate) |
| Marta leaves during retreat | Low | Critical | Communicate clearly, ensure she has consistent work, maintain relationship |
| Ad spend doesn't generate returns | High (short-term) | Low | Budget is small ($500-1K), treat as learning investment, not revenue driver |
| Wei returns to an empty pipeline | Medium | High | This is the scenario the entire plan is designed to prevent. If pre-retreat execution is strong, this risk drops significantly. |

---

## Immediate Next Actions (This Week)

1. **Today/Tomorrow:** Draft the Robertas proposal with specific terms. Don't overthink it — send something concrete and iterate.
2. **This week:** Have the expanded partnership conversation with Rob. Frame it as: "What would it look like if we worked together on an ongoing basis through Q2?"
3. **This week:** Turn on the LinkedIn DM and email outbound systems. Configure for law firm vertical, hourly engagements.
4. **This week:** Send follow-up messages to Sherrod and AJ (one each, low-effort, just to see if there's movement).
5. **This weekend:** Make the list of 20 past clients/contacts for network re-activation outreach.
6. **Next Monday:** Start the outreach to the top 20 network contacts.
7. **Next week:** Talk to friend about Facebook ad basics. Set up the first small ad test.
