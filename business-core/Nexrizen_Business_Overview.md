## Company Summary

Nexrizen is an AI consultancy and rapid development firm founded by Wei, specializing in custom software solutions for small businesses. The company's marketing tagline is "3 Days AI" emphasizing speed, though actual delivery timelines are 3-12 weeks depending on project complexity - still faster than most competitors. Nexrizen has developed deep expertise in the legal sector, particularly immigration law firms.

Wei brings a PhD in data science from Georgia Tech and experience at Meta to the business. He also serves as Fractional CTO at Saenz-Garcia Law, which reinforces the company's credibility in legal tech.

## Team Structure

| Role | Person | Responsibilities |
|------|--------|------------------|
| CEO | Wei (Weipeng Zhuo, PhD ABD) | Sales (Upwork + LinkedIn leads from his profile), strategy, client relationships, thought leadership, proposal building, Fractional CTO at Saenz-Garcia Law |
| CTO | Gabe (Gabriel Perez) | Technical leadership, sales (LinkedIn leads from his profile), daily LinkedIn content, demos, partnership development |
| Senior Data Scientist | Zhimin Gao, PhD | Data science, AI/ML development |
| Senior Data Scientist | Sol Ah Lee, PhD | Data science, AI/ML development |
| Engineers | 3 full-stack developers | Product development, client delivery |
| VA | Ruth | LinkedIn outreach execution, Upwork application assistance, CRM/lead management, SOP execution - capable of running LinkedIn outreach system with proper SOPs |

**Team size:** 8 total (2 founders, 2 PhDs, 3 engineers, 1 VA)
**Website claim:** "100+ years of combined experience"

**Current Capacity Note:** Gabe is overworked. Wei is taking on more proposal building and sales calls (except intro calls from Gabe's LinkedIn) to redistribute load. Wei has ~20 hours/week max for marketing/sales work.

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams

1. **Project Revenue** - Custom development projects ($3K-$30K+ depending on scope)
2. **Fractional CTO Services** - Ongoing strategic technical leadership (Wei and Gabe sell individually)
3. **Maintenance Packages** - Recurring monthly revenue ($300-600/month per client)

### Pyramid Pricing Strategy (In Development)

The company is building a tiered offer structure:

| Tier | Offering | Price |
|------|----------|-------|
| Free | Webinar / Lead Magnet | $0 |
| Entry | Baseline implementation (e.g., starter voice agent) | ~$2K |
| Mid | Full build / automation package | $10-15K |
| High | Fractional CTO / comprehensive engagement | $50K+ |

**Maintenance upsell:** Every implementation includes a pitch for monthly maintenance package ($300-600/month), creating passive recurring revenue that funds tech/client service team growth.

### Current Financial State

| Metric | Current State |
|--------|---------------|
| Monthly Revenue | ~$10K |
| Target (pre-retreat) | ~$15K |
| Maintenance Clients | 0 (first round of projects still ongoing) |
| Margins | Thin (due to internal systems investment) |

---

## Service Offerings

### Productized Menu (for outside Upwork - LinkedIn, referrals, direct)

1. **Voice AI Bots** - Automated voice systems for client intake, scheduling, and information delivery
2. **Custom Dashboards** - Data visualization and analytics tools, particularly for legal practice management
3. **Chatbots** - Conversational AI for client-facing support and internal workflows
4. **Live Meeting AI Coaching System** - Real-time AI assistance during meetings for coaching and guidance

All four have at least one existing client. Case studies and demos exist but need to be built out and posted (SOP needed).

### Upwork Projects

General custom development work - anything the team can deliver well that isn't overly complex. More opportunistic and varied than the productized menu.

### Fractional CTO Services

Both Wei and Gabe sell fractional CTO engagements individually. Provides ongoing strategic technical leadership to clients who need executive-level guidance without a full-time hire.

### Law Firm Specific: Discovery & Design

A strategic service for legal practices that includes understanding their current operations and designing a technology roadmap and systems architecture. Positions Nexrizen as a strategic partner rather than just an implementation vendor.

## Lead Generation & Sales

### Current Lead Sources

| Channel | Status | Volume | Quality |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| Upwork (Wei's profile) | Primary | ~5 calls/week (30 min each) | Warm, ~50% close rate |
| LinkedIn/Dripify (Sales Coach AI campaign) | Active, growing | ~10 calls/week (15 min each) | Colder, close rate TBD |
| Immigration law firm network | Secondary | Variable | Mixed (some know Wei by name, some are conference contacts) |

**Current total:** ~15 calls/week but many are low-quality intros
**Target:** 10 qualified (serious buyer) calls/week before retreat

### Sales Process

- **Upwork leads:** Wei handles end-to-end
- **LinkedIn leads:** Whoever's profile generated the lead takes the intro call (Wei or Gabe); Wei handles most follow-on sales calls
- **Problem:** Too many meeting touchpoints per deal (requirements, solution architecting, proposal negotiation, contract). Looking to reduce via async methods, recorded demos, self-service tools.

### Tools in Use

- **Dripify** - LinkedIn connection automation
- **GoHighLevel** - CRM and funnel management (not fully implemented yet)
- **Notion** - Task management, CRM, SOPs

### LinkedIn Program (Just Starting)

Currently enrolled in a LinkedIn-based outbound sales system designed to book ~5 qualified calls/week. The program provides:
- ICP targeting frameworks
- Outreach scripts and messaging
- AI-assisted personalization workflows
- Follow-up and qualification systems

**Team involvement:** All three (Wei, Gabe, Ruth) will work on it. Ruth can execute outreach with proper SOPs. Wei and Gabe need to design funnels, ICPs, and handle sales calls.

### Webinar Strategy (Planned)

Testing 1-to-many sales approach:
- Free webinars using lead magnets
- Pitch services during webinar
- Feed into pyramid pricing structure
- **Status:** New territory, no webinars run yet

---

## Internal Systems & Operations

Nexrizen is investing heavily in building internal AI-assisted systems for:

- Sales automation
- Proposal writing
- Development workflows
- Content creation

These systems are functional and in active use but still under significant development. The investment in these systems is a primary reason for currently thin margins.

**Long-term vision:** These internal operations, systems, and technology could be sold as a separate asset from the agency itself.

---

## Critical Near-Term Constraint

**Wei's Retreat:** Wei will be unavailable for approximately 1.5 months for a silent meditation retreat.

**Timeline:** ~2.5 months to prepare before retreat begins

**Implications:**
- Upwork leads (Wei's profile) will pause
- Wei's sales calls will pause
- LinkedIn outreach must be operational and sustainable without Wei
- Gabe must be able to close deals independently
- Pipeline must be built before Wei leaves

**Success Criteria for Retreat Period:**
- 10 qualified calls/week flowing to Gabe
- $15K/month revenue achieved before departure
- LinkedIn system running with Ruth executing
- Clear sales handoff process documented

---

## Strategic Priorities

### Active Focus Areas
1. LinkedIn program execution (primary Upwork replacement strategy)
2. Law firm network warm outreach (voice demo campaigns)
3. Website rewrite for new positioning (blocking lead conversion)
4. Case study / demo / social proof buildout (SOP needed)
5. Sales process documentation for handoff

### Icebox (Post-Retreat)
- Video marketing system (HeyGen pipeline)
- Email marketing (Mailchimp)
- Community events
- Local SMB outreach
- TikTok
- SEO/GEO automation
- Business books (E-myth, $100M series, 4-Hour Work Week, Traction)

---

## Exit Strategy

**Timeline:** Approximately 5 years

**Potential Assets to Sell:**

1. **The agency** - Client relationships, team, recurring revenue (maintenance packages), reputation
2. **Internal systems/tech** - The AI-assisted operations infrastructure being built for sales, proposals, and development

**Key to Exit Value:** Building recurring maintenance revenue base. More past clients on maintenance = more passive revenue = more valuable asset.

---

## Strengths

- Faster delivery than most competitors (3-12 weeks vs industry norms)
- Deep expertise in legal tech, particularly immigration law
- Strong founder credentials (PhD, Meta, speaking at AILA)
- Multiple revenue streams (projects, fractional CTO, maintenance)
- All four menu items have existing clients
- Building proprietary internal systems with potential standalone value
- Daily LinkedIn content cadence established
- Smart VA (Ruth) capable of running outreach with proper SOPs
- High close rate on warm Upwork leads (~50%)

### Public Proof Points (from website)
- **50+ production apps shipped**
- **7,000+ users scaled** (Georgia Tech project)
- **$500K+ revenue generated** for clients
- **1,000+ daily conversations** handled by AI systems
- **AILA Technology Innovation Winner**
- Strong positioning: "No PMs, no junior devs, no handoffs"

## Challenges & Risks

- Heavy dependence on Wei for lead generation and sales
- Upwork dependency for primary qualified lead flow
- Gabe is overworked
- Thin margins limiting runway and hiring
- 2.5-month deadline to de-risk the retreat period
- No maintenance clients yet (recurring revenue not started)
- LinkedIn close rates unknown/likely lower than Upwork
- Too many meetings per deal
- Voice demo still being polished
- Case studies/demos not yet posted
- Webinar strategy untested

---

## Open Questions

- Which menu item should be the "hero offer" for the next 2.5 months?
- What's the minimum viable sales handoff documentation?
- How to reduce meetings-per-deal?
- What's the realistic LinkedIn close rate going to be?
- When will first maintenance clients come online?
