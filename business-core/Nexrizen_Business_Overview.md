## Company Summary

Nexrizen is an AI consultancy and rapid development firm founded by Wei, specializing in custom software solutions for small businesses. The company's marketing tagline is "3 Days AI" emphasizing speed, though actual delivery timelines are 3-12 weeks depending on project complexity - still faster than most competitors. Nexrizen has developed deep expertise in the legal sector, particularly immigration law firms.

Wei brings a PhD in data science from Georgia Tech and experience at Meta to the business. He also serves as Fractional CTO at Saenz-Garcia Law, which reinforces the company's credibility in legal tech.

## Team Structure

| Role | Person | Responsibilities |
|------|--------|------------------|
| CEO | Wei (Weipeng Zhuo, PhD ABD) | Sales (Upwork + LinkedIn leads from his profile), strategy, client relationships, thought leadership, proposal building, Fractional CTO at Saenz-Garcia Law |
| CTO | Gabe (Gabriel Perez) | Technical leadership, sales (LinkedIn leads from his profile), daily LinkedIn content, demos, partnership development |
| Senior Data Scientist | Zhimin Gao, PhD | Data science, AI/ML development |
| Senior Data Scientist | Sol Ah Lee, PhD | Data science, AI/ML development |
| Engineers | 3 full-stack developers | Product development, client delivery |
| VA | Ruth | LinkedIn outreach execution, Upwork application assistance, CRM/lead management, SOP execution - capable of running LinkedIn outreach system with proper SOPs |

**Team size:** 8 total (2 founders, 2 PhDs, 3 engineers, 1 VA)
**Website claim:** "100+ years of combined experience"

**Current Capacity Note:** Gabe is overworked. Wei is taking on more proposal building and sales calls (except intro calls from Gabe's LinkedIn) to redistribute load. Wei has ~20 hours/week max for marketing/sales work.

---

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams

1. **Project Revenue** - Custom development projects ($3K-$30K+ depending on scope)
2. **Fractional CTO Services** - Ongoing strategic technical leadership (Wei and Gabe sell individually)
3. **Maintenance Packages** - Recurring monthly revenue ($300-600/month per client)

### Pyramid Pricing Strategy (In Development)

The company is building a tiered offer structure:

| Tier | Offering | Price |
|------|----------|-------|
| Free | Webinar / Lead Magnet | $0 |
| Entry | Baseline implementation (e.g., starter voice agent) | ~$2K |
| Mid | Full build / automation package | $10-15K |
| High | Fractional CTO / comprehensive engagement | $50K+ |

**Maintenance upsell:** Every implementation includes a pitch for monthly maintenance package ($300-600/month), creating passive recurring revenue that funds tech/client service team growth.

### Current Financial State

| Metric | Current State |
|--------|---------------|
| Monthly Revenue | ~$10K |
| Target (pre-retreat) | ~$15K |
| Maintenance Clients | 0 (first round of projects still ongoing) |
| Margins | Thin (due to internal systems investment) |

### Pricing Philosophy & Why It Works

**"First-World Expertise at Third-World Prices" - But NOT Because We're Cheap**

From Nick meeting (Nov 2025), validated pricing model:
- **Price anchoring:** $3K / $6K / $10K tiers
- **Result:** 60%+ choose $6K (middle tier)
- **First month performance:** 10 projects completed, 10-12 in waitlist

**Why we can offer competitive rates:**

1. **AI systems reduce delivery time** - What takes others 6 months, we do in 3-12 weeks
2. **No PM/admin overhead** - Direct founder involvement, no layers
3. **Automated workflows** - Proposal Builder (20-30x time savings), Demo Generator
4. **Senior-only team** - 8 people (not 80) with 100+ years combined experience

**As Wei explained to Israel:**
> "Execution is cheap these days with AI. What's expensive is domain expertise, your network, your ability to close deals. We handle execution—fast, efficiently, at a cost that makes sense because we've built systems that let us deliver like a team of 20 with a team of 8."

### Unique Sales Approach: "Proof Before Payment"

**Automated demo generation** (validated in Nick meeting):
- **90% response rate** on Upwork (vs industry 5-10%)
- **75-80% conversion** from demo to client
- **~50% close rate** on Upwork warm leads overall

**How it works:**
- Read project description → AI generates front-end demo
- Hosted on demos.nexrizen.com subdomain
- Sent with initial application/proposal
- **No competitor does this**

**Client reactions (Israel meeting):**
> "That's crazy. That's what I did. But you're on steroids."

**Partnership models validated:**

1. **"Dating Phase" Model (Israel):**
   - Work together hourly first (10-20 hours/week)
   - See if we're compatible
   - Then talk equity/partnership if it works
   - De-risks both sides

2. **White Label Model (Nick):**
   - Partner agencies send greenfield rapid projects → Nexrizen
   - Nexrizen can work under partner brand
   - Build MVP foundation for partner's larger projects
   - Complementary, not competitive

3. **Fractional CTO → Equity (Multiple meetings):**
   - Start as strategic advisor (hourly)
   - "Run with me" partnership
   - Convert to equity stake if value proven

### Recurring Revenue Strategy

**$500-$1,000/month managed services** (Nick meeting validated):
- Continuous on-call support
- Priority access for new features (skip waitlist)
- Hosting included
- Subscription model = predictable recurring revenue

**Current target:** Convert 30-50% of project clients to managed services within 3 months

## Service Offerings

### Productized Menu (for outside Upwork - LinkedIn, referrals, direct)

1. **Voice AI Bots** - Automated voice systems for client intake, scheduling, and information delivery
2. **Custom Dashboards** - Data visualization and analytics tools, particularly for legal practice management
3. **Chatbots** - Conversational AI for client-facing support and internal workflows
4. **Live Meeting AI Coaching System** - Real-time AI assistance during meetings for coaching and guidance

All four have at least one existing client. Case studies and demos exist but need to be built out and posted (SOP needed).

### Upwork Projects

General custom development work - anything the team can deliver well that isn't overly complex. More opportunistic and varied than the productized menu.

### Fractional CTO Services

Both Wei and Gabe sell fractional CTO engagements individually. Provides ongoing strategic technical leadership to clients who need executive-level guidance without a full-time hire.

### Law Firm Specific: Discovery & Design

A strategic service for legal practices that includes understanding their current operations and designing a technology roadmap and systems architecture. Positions Nexrizen as a strategic partner rather than just an implementation vendor.

## Lead Generation & Sales

### Current Lead Sources

| Channel | Status | Volume | Quality |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| Upwork (Wei's profile) | Primary | ~5 calls/week (30 min each) | Warm, ~50% close rate |
| LinkedIn/Dripify (Sales Coach AI campaign) | Active, growing | ~10 calls/week (15 min each) | Colder, close rate TBD |
| Immigration law firm network | Secondary | Variable | Mixed (some know Wei by name, some are conference contacts) |

**Current total:** ~15 calls/week but many are low-quality intros
**Target:** 10 qualified (serious buyer) calls/week before retreat

### Sales Process

- **Upwork leads:** Wei handles end-to-end
- **LinkedIn leads:** Whoever's profile generated the lead takes the intro call (Wei or Gabe); Wei handles most follow-on sales calls
- **Problem:** Too many meeting touchpoints per deal (requirements, solution architecting, proposal negotiation, contract). Looking to reduce via async methods, recorded demos, self-service tools.

### Tools in Use

- **Dripify** - LinkedIn connection automation
- **GoHighLevel** - CRM and funnel management (not fully implemented yet)
- **Notion** - Task management, CRM, SOPs

### LinkedIn Program (Just Starting)

Currently enrolled in a LinkedIn-based outbound sales system designed to book ~5 qualified calls/week. The program provides:
- ICP targeting frameworks
- Outreach scripts and messaging
- AI-assisted personalization workflows
- Follow-up and qualification systems

**Team involvement:** All three (Wei, Gabe, Ruth) will work on it. Ruth can execute outreach with proper SOPs. Wei and Gabe need to design funnels, ICPs, and handle sales calls.

### Webinar Strategy (Planned)

Testing 1-to-many sales approach:
- Free webinars using lead magnets
- Pitch services during webinar
- Feed into pyramid pricing structure
- **Status:** New territory, no webinars run yet

---

## Internal Systems & Operations

Nexrizen is investing heavily in building internal AI-assisted systems for:

- Sales automation
- Proposal writing
- Development workflows
- Content creation

These systems are functional and in active use but still under significant development. The investment in these systems is a primary reason for currently thin margins.

**Long-term vision:** These internal operations, systems, and technology could be sold as a separate asset from the agency itself.

---

## Critical Near-Term Constraint

**Wei's Retreat:** Wei will be unavailable for approximately 1.5 months for a silent meditation retreat.

**Timeline:** ~2.5 months to prepare before retreat begins

**Implications:**
- Upwork leads (Wei's profile) will pause
- Wei's sales calls will pause
- LinkedIn outreach must be operational and sustainable without Wei
- Gabe must be able to close deals independently
- Pipeline must be built before Wei leaves

**Success Criteria for Retreat Period:**
- 10 qualified calls/week flowing to Gabe
- $15K/month revenue achieved before departure
- LinkedIn system running with Ruth executing
- Clear sales handoff process documented

---

## Scale Opportunities Explored

### Current Reality: "Frying Small Fish"

**Wei's exact words to Zane (VC partner, Feb 2026):**
> "We're creating such cool stuff every single day, and we're leveraging the coolest shit, but we're **fucking frying small fish** right now, Zane. We're looking at Upwork for small clients. People don't have money in Upwork... Immigration law firms also don't have too much money. A lot of them are just small fish. We're showing them these demos... How do we scale?"

### What Nexrizen Has (Internal IP)

1. **Proposal Builder** - 20-30x time reduction, auto-generates demos
   - Auto-ingests meeting transcripts, emails, documents
   - Deep research on competitors/tools
   - Solution architecture generation
   - **One-click prototype generation** (working UI from requirements)
   - Interactive web proposals (not static PDFs)

2. **Business Builder** (In Development) - Operating system for agencies
   - Ingest ALL business context (Slack, meetings, strategies, financials)
   - Answer: "Who's doing well?", "Which projects?", "Who to hire?"
   - Weekly team evaluations
   - Business coaching + forecasting

   - **Israel GoldPro validated:** $100K/month revenue potential for construction

4. **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - 1,000 leads/day system for law firm
   - Confidence scoring (<80% → human review)
   - Machine learning feedback loop
   - **Thomas meeting validated:** Essay service saves ~$50K/year

### The Gap

**What Nexrizen Has:**
- World-class technology
- Proprietary AI systems
- CTO-level team (ex-Meta, Georgia Tech PhDs)
- "First-world expertise at third-world prices"

**What Nexrizen Lacks:**
- Access to clients who can pay for value
- Distribution beyond Upwork/small clients
- Brand recognition in high-value markets
- Capital to scale operations

### Scale Pathways Being Explored

**Option 1: VC-Backed Product Spinout**

From Zane meeting:
- **Pitch:** $25-50M raise, team of PhDs building AI products
- **Connections:** a16z, Sequoia, Google Ventures, SoftBank
- **Investor interest (per Zane):**
  - SoftBank: "Up to $500M if leader is going to change the way business is done"
  - UAE state funds: "$100-200M, we want this in Dubai"
  - Multiple VCs reached out about similar tools

**Products to spin out:**
- **Proposal Builder** for consultancies/agencies
- **Business Builder** as standalone SaaS for agencies
- **Live Sales Coaching** for insurance, construction, remodeling
- Keep proprietary versions, sell lite versions

**Option 2: Partnership-Led Growth**

From Israel, Nick, Robertas, Gianfranco meetings:

1. **Robertas (EU Fintech)**
   - Partnership model: He brings clients, Nexrizen executes
   - Target: Insurance companies, private aviation, investment firms
   - Revenue share or equity arrangement

2. **Nick (Complementary Agency)**
   - White-label rapid prototyping services
   - He sends greenfield → Nexrizen
   - Nexrizen sends brownfield → Nick
   - "There's enough pie for everyone"

3. **Gianfranco (Legal Marketing)**
   - Legal marketing agency partnership
   - He has access to law firms, Nexrizen builds tech
   - **Insight:** Consultancy/guidance >> Software sales

4. **Israel ("Run With Me" Model)**
   - Fractional CTO → equity partnership
   - Dating phase first (hourly), then equity
   - GoldPro construction: $100K/month validated
   - Multiple similar opportunities exist

**Option 3: Vertical-Specific Product Companies**

From validated use cases in meetings:

1. **PI Law Firm Intake AI** (Gianfranco validated as #1 legal vertical)
   - "60% hire first firm they talk to" - speed wins
   - Immigration system (1,000/day) proves capability
   - Omni-channel lead capture
   - **Market:** Most money in legal, fastest decisions

2. **Construction Live AI Coaching** (Israel validated)
   - Video AI for walkthrough guidance
   - Automated proposal generation
   - Insurance documentation
   - **Proof:** GoldPro $100K/month potential

3. **Professional Services Automation** (Thomas validated)
   - Multi-agent orchestration
   - Essay services, OnlyFans agencies
   - ~$50K/year savings per client
   - **Product opportunity:** Chat automation SaaS

**Option 4: Scale Current Agency Model**

Move off Upwork dependency:
- Direct outreach to mid-size companies ($5-20M revenue)
- Partner with industry agencies for distribution
- Enterprise contracts (multi-location firms)
- Conference-driven sales (half of Nick's first month came from conferences)

### Decision Timeline

**Short-term (Next 90 days - Pre-Retreat):**
- Focus on agency revenue ($15K/month target)
- Validate pricing model ($3K/$6K/$10K tiers)
- Build managed services pipeline ($500-$1K/month recurring)
- Document sales process for Gabe handoff

**Medium-term (Post-Retreat, 3-6 months):**
- Re-evaluate after retreat period
- Decide: Keep Proposal Builder/Business Builder internal vs spin out
- Test partnership models (Israel, Nick, Robertas, Gianfranco)
- Explore OnlyFans chat automation SaaS (Thomas opportunity)

**Long-term (12+ months):**
- If VC path: Raise capital for product spinout
- If partnership path: Scale through partner distribution
- If agency path: Grow to $50K+/month, then exit

---

## Strategic Priorities

### Active Focus Areas
1. LinkedIn program execution (primary Upwork replacement strategy)
2. Law firm network warm outreach (voice demo campaigns)
3. Website rewrite for new positioning (blocking lead conversion)
4. Case study / demo / social proof buildout (SOP needed)
5. Sales process documentation for handoff

### Icebox (Post-Retreat)
- Video marketing system (HeyGen pipeline)
- Email marketing (Mailchimp)
- Community events
- Local SMB outreach
- TikTok
- SEO/GEO automation
- Business books (E-myth, $100M series, 4-Hour Work Week, Traction)

---

## Exit Strategy

**Timeline:** Approximately 5 years

**Potential Assets to Sell:**

1. **The agency** - Client relationships, team, recurring revenue (maintenance packages), reputation
2. **Internal systems/tech** - The AI-assisted operations infrastructure being built for sales, proposals, and development

**Key to Exit Value:** Building recurring maintenance revenue base. More past clients on maintenance = more passive revenue = more valuable asset.

---

## Strengths

- Faster delivery than most competitors (3-12 weeks vs industry norms)
- Deep expertise in legal tech, particularly immigration law
- Strong founder credentials (PhD, Meta, speaking at AILA)
- Multiple revenue streams (projects, fractional CTO, maintenance)
- All four menu items have existing clients
- Building proprietary internal systems with potential standalone value
- Daily LinkedIn content cadence established
- Smart VA (Ruth) capable of running outreach with proper SOPs
- High close rate on warm Upwork leads (~50%)

### Public Proof Points (from website)
- **50+ production apps shipped**
- **7,000+ users scaled** (Georgia Tech project)
- **$500K+ revenue generated** for clients
- **1,000+ daily conversations** handled by AI systems
- **AILA Technology Innovation Winner**
- Strong positioning: "No PMs, no junior devs, no handoffs"

## Challenges & Risks

- Heavy dependence on Wei for lead generation and sales
- Upwork dependency for primary qualified lead flow
- Gabe is overworked
- Thin margins limiting runway and hiring
- 2.5-month deadline to de-risk the retreat period
- No maintenance clients yet (recurring revenue not started)
- LinkedIn close rates unknown/likely lower than Upwork
- Too many meetings per deal
- Voice demo still being polished
- Case studies/demos not yet posted
- Webinar strategy untested

---

## Open Questions

- Which menu item should be the "hero offer" for the next 2.5 months?
- What's the minimum viable sales handoff documentation?
- How to reduce meetings-per-deal?
- What's the realistic LinkedIn close rate going to be?
- When will first maintenance clients come online?
