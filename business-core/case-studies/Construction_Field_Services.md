## Case Study 2: Restoration Company Documentation AI

**Client Type:** Construction / Restoration Services
**Project:** Video-Based Insurance Documentation System

### Problem
- Fire/flood restoration technicians taking inconsistent job site photos/videos
- Office staff struggling to communicate what documentation is needed
- Insurance adjusters rejecting claims due to insufficient evidence
- Manual estimate writing taking hours per job
- Explaining line items to adjusters = time-consuming back-and-forth

### Solution
Video analysis AI system that:
1. **Guided Documentation** - AI tells technician what to capture in real-time during walkthrough
   - "Zoom in on water damage on baseboards"
   - "Record moisture readings in this area"
   - "Show full room scope before closeups"
2. **Post-Walk Analysis** - Processes video to identify:
   - Damage type and severity
   - Materials affected (drywall, flooring, fixtures)
   - Required remediation steps
3. **Estimate Generator** - Auto-generates line-item estimates based on:
   - IICRC standards (restoration industry standards)
   - Historical job data
   - Current material costs
4. **Adjuster Communication Bot** - Auto-generates justification emails citing IICRC standards

### Results (Projected)
- **Reduce estimate writing time** from 2-3 hours to <30 minutes
- **Improve insurance claim acceptance rate** through consistent documentation
- **Scale with less-experienced technicians** (AI guides them)
- **Automated adjuster follow-ups** (email sequences with IICRC citations)

### Technologies
- Computer vision / video analysis
- Real-time AI coaching (similar to live sales coaching system)
- IICRC knowledge base integration
- Automated email sequencing

### Timeline
- Phase 1 (Post-walk video analysis): 3-6 weeks
- Phase 2 (Real-time guidance): 6-8 weeks (more complex)

### Pricing
Quoted at $3-6K for Phase 1 (post-hoc analysis)
Live guidance would ~2x the price

### Team
Wei (architect), Senior Engineers + PhD data scientists (CV work)

### Sales Usage
**Use when:**
- Client has field technicians doing documentation
- Client needs to standardize quality across team skill levels
- Client deals with insurance/compliance documentation
- **Verticals:** Construction, inspection services, field services, insurance

**Key Quote from Client (Sean):**
> "I want to utilize [AI] to make my job easier and other restoration guys' jobs easier... great documentation is in the eye of the beholder. If you have a technician that doesn't know what the heck to take a picture of, he's gonna take a picture of whatever he thinks he needs."

## Case Study 5: Saudi Arabia Construction Progress Tracking

**Client Type:** Construction / Real Estate Development
**Project:** Video-Based Construction Progress Monitoring

### Problem
- Large construction projects with hundreds of tasks
- Need to track % completion of each aspect (electrical, plumbing, drywall, etc.)
- Manual inspection time-consuming and inconsistent
- Hard to know what areas need more footage/documentation

### Solution
Video ingestion and analysis system:
1. **Blueprint Upload** - Ingest project blueprints/floor plans
2. **Video Processing** - Technician walks through with phone camera
3. **Progress Analysis** - AI determines % complete for:
   - Electrical systems
   - Plumbing
   - Drywall/finishing
   - Flooring
   - Each room/area
4. **Guidance System** - AI knows where tech should walk based on blueprint
5. **Gap Identification** - "You need more footage of the northwest wing electrical"

### Results (In Development)
- **Automated progress tracking** without manual checklists
- **Consistent documentation** across multiple sites
- **Early problem detection** (if progress stalls in one area)
- **Client reporting automation** (send weekly progress videos/reports)

### Technologies
- Computer vision
- Blueprint/floor plan analysis
- Video analysis
- Spatial reasoning AI

### Timeline
Currently in development

### Client
Saudi Arabia-based construction/development company

### Team
Wei (architect), CV specialists

### Sales Usage
**Use when:**
- Client manages multiple construction/renovation projects
- Client needs consistent progress tracking
- Client has field teams doing site visits
- **Verticals:** Construction, real estate development, facilities management, inspection services

**Connection to Restoration Case Study:**
Very similar tech stack - could bundle as "Field Documentation Suite"

## Case Study 16: Restoration Company GHL Automation

**Client:** Sean Galloway (Restoration Company Owner)
**Client Type:** Home Services / Water Damage Restoration
**Project:** Go High Level CRM automation for client updates and lead follow-up
**Status:** 📝 Discovery (SOPs to be provided)

### Problem
- Office staff manually sends job progress updates to clients
- BDR (Business Development Rep) manually follows up with plumber leads
- Technicians need reminders to upload job site photos
- Simplifying office duties is top priority

### Solution
Smart automated client outreach based on GHL notes. Progress updates triggered by job status changes. Automated lead nurture sequence for BDR's plumber pipeline. Technician reminders for photo uploads when dispatched to new jobs. Integration with existing GHL CRM (not building from scratch).

### Technologies
- Go High Level
- CRM automation
- SMS/Email sequences
- Workflow automation
- OpenAI/GHL AI integration

### Timeline
"Not that long" (expedited)

### Team
Wei + GHL specialist

### Sales Usage
Perfect for home services, field service businesses, restoration/construction companies, any business with job-based client communication needs. **Unique differentiator:** Leverages existing GHL infrastructure rather than custom build - faster and more maintainable.
