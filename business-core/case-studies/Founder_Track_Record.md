# Founder Track Record — Cross-Reference Index

**Purpose:** Quick-lookup index for the founders' 25 pre-Nexrizen projects. Full case study details live in the vertical files linked below.

**Total Projects:** 25 (Wei: 19, Gabe: 6)

**Why This Matters for Sales:**
Many of Nexrizen's most impressive metrics (100x processing speed, $2M/month saved, 10x cost reduction) come from pre-Nexrizen work. These case studies give salespeople the context behind the numbers.

> **Important:** These are NOT Nexrizen client projects. Frame them as "our founders' track record" or "what our team has built before," not as Nexrizen deliverables.
