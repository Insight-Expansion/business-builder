## Contributing Guidelines

When adding new case studies:
1. **Add directly to the appropriate vertical file** (this index file has no case study content)
2. **If no vertical fits**, add to Emerging_Verticals.md or create a new vertical file if 3+ projects warrant it
3. **Update this index** — update the Vertical Files table counts
4. **Update README.md** — update counts and Quick Reference tables
5. **Follow metadata template** (see CLAUDE.md for standards)
6. **Get client authorization** before making public

### Founder Track Record Projects
- Always under `## Founder Track Record (Pre-Nexrizen)` section in vertical files
- Include disclaimer: _"These are NOT Nexrizen client projects"_
- Use F-number prefix (F1-F25) for consistent cross-referencing
- See [Founder_Track_Record.md](Founder_Track_Record.md) for complete cross-reference index
