## Case Study 24: Dreamily Personalized Children's Books

**Client:** Nick (Australia-based Director)
**Client Type:** Publishing / E-commerce / Personalized Gifts
**Project:** AI-generated personalized children's books (physical, gift-wrapped delivery)
**Status:** 📝 NDA to be signed, POC under consideration
**Budget:** ~$2K for MVP (content generation workflow)

### Problem
- Struggled 1.5 years to build technical backend
- Need consistent story generation and character creation
- **Biggest issue:** Character consistency across 15-20 pages (5-year-old Chloe changes appearance)

### Solution
User inputs memorable moment with child (e.g., beach trip, seagulls). AI generates whimsical story around that moment. Age-appropriate content (page count and writing style based on child's age). Pixar-style character imagery with consistency across pages (exploring better models than Dall-E). Format ready for printing (PDF handoff to printer).

**Future Features:**
- School market (anti-bullying, educational themes)
- Possible add-on: Animated video trailer of the book
