### Problem
- Insurance sales reps need to follow specific methodologies (Jordan Belfort, Jeremy Miner frameworks)
- New reps don't know how to handle objections
- Managers can't be on every call coaching in real-time
- Training is slow and expensive

### Solution
Live call coaching AI that:
1. **Real-time transcription** - Converts call audio to text live

4. **Live suggestions** - Tells agent what to say next based on:
   - Objection type detected
   - Sales methodology best practices
   - Historical success patterns
5. **Training mode** - New agents can use for every call until proficient

**Not Fully Autonomous** - Provides suggestions, agent delivers them (human in loop)
