**Key Insight:**

This repository represents **58 documented projects** — 33 Nexrizen client projects plus 25 pre-Nexrizen founder track record projects, all organized into 11 industry verticals. The strongest proof points are:
1. **Healthcare & Life Sciences** (7 case studies) — Johns Hopkins, Genentech/Roche, OMNY Health, published research
2. **Data & Analytics** (9 case studies) — Meta ($2M/mo), Fortune 100 (100x speed), government dashboards
3. **Emerging Verticals** (12 case studies) — Breadth of capability across EdTech, AgriTech, voice AI
4. **Legal Tech** (6 case studies) — Wei's Fractional CTO role provides massive credibility
5. **Sales & Marketing** (6 case studies) — ContactAI (800% engagement), live coaching, brand analytics
6. **Internal/Meta** (5 case studies) — Proprietary systems = competitive advantage

**Strategic Recommendation:** Double down on Legal Tech (proven), package Internal systems as products (Proposal Builder, Business Builder), leverage Healthcare & Life Sciences for enterprise credibility (Johns Hopkins, Genentech, published research), and watch Emerging for patterns that could become new verticals.
