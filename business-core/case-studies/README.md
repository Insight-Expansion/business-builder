**Key Insight:**

This repository represents **33 documented projects** across **10 verticals**. The strongest verticals are:
1. **Legal Tech** (6 case studies) - Wei's Fractional CTO role provides massive credibility
2. **Internal/Meta** (4 case studies) - Proprietary systems = competitive advantage
3. **Data/Analytics** (4 case studies) - High-value, expert-level work
4. **Emerging** (7 case studies) - Breadth of capability, pattern recognition

**Strategic Recommendation:** Double down on Legal Tech (proven), package Internal systems as products (Proposal Builder, Business Builder), and watch Emerging for patterns that could become new verticals.
