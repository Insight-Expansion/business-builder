## Pre-Retreat Action Plan

### Weeks 1-2: Activate & Propose (February 14 - February 28)

#### Partnerships — Do This First

- [ ] Draft and send concrete proposal to Robertas by end of this week. Include: services Nexrizen provides, pricing/rate structure, lead handoff process, payment terms, suggested first project or trial period.
- [ ] Have expanded partnership conversation with Rob. Ask directly: would you be interested in an ongoing hourly arrangement that provides consistent work through Q2? Propose specific terms.
- [ ] Send one follow-up each to Sherrod and AJ. If either responds with concrete next steps, engage. If not, park them.
- [ ] **Hard internal deadline:** If Robertas and Rob haven't committed to terms by end of Week 3, shift all energy to outbound systems.

#### Outbound Systems — Turn Them On

- [ ] Activate LinkedIn DM campaign sequences. Target: law firm decision makers, legal operations managers, immigration practice owners.
- [ ] Activate email outbound sequences. Use law firm vertical messaging (outcomes: efficiency, never losing consultation details, real-time practice visibility).
- [ ] Configure messaging for hourly engagements, not fixed-price projects. Pitch: fractional AI/tech team, not one-off project delivery.
- [ ] Set volume targets: 5-10 qualified conversations per week within 2 weeks.

#### Paid Ads — Plant Seeds

- [ ] Set up small Meta or LinkedIn ad campaign ($500 budget for first month).
- [ ] Talk to friend about Facebook ads basics — get their playbook for Airbnb B&B campaigns.
- [ ] Create simple landing page or funnel for ad traffic.
- [ ] Goal: data and learning, not immediate revenue.

#### Network Re-Activation

- [ ] Make a list of every past client, conference contact, and warm connection who could either become a client or refer one.
- [ ] Send personalized outreach to top 20. Not a sales pitch — genuine check-in mentioning Nexrizen's current services and availability.
- [ ] Reactivate any old leads that went cold.

#### Upwork — Continue But Shift

- [ ] Continue Upwork lead gen at current pace for Weeks 1-2.
- [ ] Be highly selective: only pursue hourly projects, $10K+ total value, starting within 1-2 weeks.
- [ ] Begin documenting Upwork process for potential handoff (even partial) to Gabe or Ruth.

---

### Weeks 3-4: Assess & Train (March 1 - March 14)

#### Partnership Check-In

- [ ] Are Robertas and/or Rob committed? If yes: structure deals to provide work through April-May. Get in writing (contract, SOW, or detailed email agreement).
- [ ] If neither committed: accept that partnerships won't carry the retreat — double down on outbound + pre-loaded pipeline.

#### Outbound Performance Review

- [ ] How many qualified conversations have LinkedIn DM and email campaigns generated?
- [ ] Are any converting to actual calls or proposals?
- [ ] Adjust sequences, messaging, and targeting based on first 2 weeks of data.
- [ ] If outbound is generating warm leads, this becomes the primary retreat-proof channel.

#### Gabe Training

- [ ] Begin training Gabe on handling warm inbound leads: qualifying, first call, scoping hourly engagement, sending a proposal.
- [ ] NOT training Gabe to run the full Upwork grind — training him to convert leads from automated or partnership channels.
- [ ] Do 2-3 practice runs where Gabe leads a sales conversation with Wei observing.

#### Upwork Wind-Down

- [ ] Stop accepting new Upwork projects starting after March 15.
- [ ] Focus remaining Upwork effort on closing the 2 good leads Wei has been nurturing.
- [ ] Begin mentally and practically decoupling from Upwork as primary revenue channel.

#### Team Decision

- [ ] Assess pipeline visibility for April-May. Enough committed hourly work to keep Marta + Susanna busy?
- [ ] If yes: maintain both through retreat.
- [ ] If not: plan to pause Susanna's hours at retreat start ($4,800/month savings). Communicate with clear expectation of resuming when Wei returns.
- [ ] Ruth decision: if Gabe isn't actively selling, Ruth's hours may not be needed. Evaluate.

---

### Weeks 4-6: Handoff & Departure (March 14 - ~March 28)

#### Pipeline Pre-Loading

- [ ] Get every possible project signed and committed before departure. Contracts over handshakes.
- [ ] For projects in final negotiation, either close or hand the relationship to Gabe with full context.
- [ ] Identify clients who might need work in April-May and proactively reach out to schedule it.

#### The Gabe Playbook

Create a single reference document covering:

- [ ] **Active clients:** Who they are, what they're paying, who on team is assigned, current status, when work expected to complete.
- [ ] **Outbound systems:** How to monitor LinkedIn DM and email campaigns. Metrics to watch. When to adjust. How to respond to positive replies.
- [ ] **Warm leads:** Open conversations, where they stand, suggested next steps.
- [ ] **Partnership contacts:** Robertas and Rob status, contact info, what's agreed, what's pending.
- [ ] **Decision criteria for new work:** Accept (hourly, $120/hr, law firm vertical preferred, can start immediately). Decline (fixed-price, under $5K, outside core expertise, requires Wei).
- [ ] **Emergency contacts:** Marta for technical issues, Wei only if truly critical.
- [ ] **Financial guardrails:** Monthly burn, minimum revenue needed, when to trigger cost reduction.

#### Automated Systems Checklist

Before departing, confirm all running:

- [ ] LinkedIn DM campaigns active and generating responses
- [ ] Email outbound sequences active
- [ ] LinkedIn content scheduled for 2-3 weeks (or Gabe takes over posting)
- [ ] Ad campaigns running (if started) with budget caps set
- [ ] Gabe has access to all relevant accounts, tools, and dashboards

#### Personal Preparation

- [ ] Ensure personal finances sustain through retreat + 2 weeks buffer after return.
- [ ] Communicate retreat to active clients. Let them know Gabe is point of contact. Reassure delivery continues as normal (Marta handles technical execution).
- [ ] Set clear boundaries: truly silent retreat, or weekly 30-minute check-in with Gabe?

## During Retreat: Gabe's Operating Plan

### Weekly Rhythm

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Monday | Review outbound campaign metrics. Respond to warm leads. Check in with Marta/Susanna on active projects. |
| Tuesday-Thursday | Handle client communications. Take sales calls if leads come in. Work on personal income (FCTO gig, contract work). |
| Friday | Weekly status update (even if just self-review). Review financials: on track? Need to cut costs? |

### Decision Framework

**Accept new work if:**
- Hourly at $120/hr or above
- Can be scoped and delivered by Marta (and Susanna if retained) without Wei
- Client understands Wei is unavailable and is okay working with Gabe as project lead
- Total commitment doesn't exceed available engineering hours

**Decline or defer if:**
- Fixed-price
- Requires Wei's specific expertise or involvement
- Client wants to start immediately but scope is unclear
- Would overcommit the engineering team

**Escalate (contact Wei only if):**
- A major client threatens to leave
- Financial emergency (burn exceeding revenue by >$5K in a single month)
- Partnership opportunity too significant to defer (e.g., Robertas brings a $50K+ deal)

### Minimum Viable Revenue Target

To break even with reduced team (assuming Susanna paused):

| Item | Monthly |
|------|---------|
| Marta (full time) | ~$9,600 |
| Ruth (if retained) | ~$1,200 |
| Other expenses | ~$1,800 |
| **Total burn** | **~$12,600** |
| **Required billable hours (Marta)** | **~105 hrs/mo at $120/hr** |
| **Marta utilization needed** | **~65%** |

This is achievable with 1-2 active hourly projects running. Pre-loading phase should aim for at least this much committed work.

## Post-Retreat Priorities (May - June 2026)

### Week 1 Back: Assessment

- Review what happened during retreat: revenue, pipeline, team status, client relationships
- Debrief with Gabe: what worked, what didn't, what surprised him
- Assess which channels generated leads and revenue while Wei was gone
- Restart outbound activity if it slowed during retreat

### Weeks 2-4: Stabilize & Build

- Re-engage any leads or partnerships that stalled during retreat
- Begin building the first Claude Code plugin for law firm vertical using workflows already developed for existing clients
- **Target:** Have a sellable product within 2-3 weeks of focused effort
- Test-sell to existing contacts: webinar audience, school community, past law firm clients

### Weeks 4-8: Test & Scale

- If organic sales generate 5-10 unit sales at $1-2K: the product has signal. Begin investing ad budget to scale.
- Evaluate AILA Texas Fall Conference as a distribution and networking event
- Consider Chicago workshop with Tarim as combined teaching + product development opportunity
- Double down on the 1-2 marketing channels that performed best during retreat; deprioritize underperformers

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target (Post-Retreat) | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------|----------------------|----------------|
| Revenue from non-Upwork channels | ~30% | 60%+ | Reduces founder dependence |
| Wei's weekly sales hours | 20-30 hrs | 10-15 hrs | Frees time for product development |
| Engineer utilization | 85%+ | 80%+ | Maintain while transitioning channels |
| Plugin/info product revenue | $0 | $5-10K | Validates the scalable model |
| Monthly gross profit | ~$12-14K | $15K+ | Supports founder compensation |
| Personal monthly draw (each founder) | $0 | $3K+ | Basic financial stability |

---

## Key Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Pipeline dries up during retreat | Medium-High | Critical | Pre-load pipeline, activate automated outbound, close partnership deals before departure |
| Partnerships don't close in time | Medium | High | Don't depend on partnerships alone; automated outbound is the reliable backup |
| Gabe can't convert warm leads to revenue | Medium | High | Train in Weeks 3-4, do practice runs, keep the close simple (hourly, standard rate) |
| Marta leaves during retreat | Low | Critical | Communicate clearly, ensure consistent work, maintain relationship |
| Ad spend doesn't generate returns | High (short-term) | Low | Budget is small ($500-1K), treat as learning investment, not revenue driver |
| Wei returns to empty pipeline | Medium | High | Entire plan designed to prevent this; if pre-retreat execution is strong, risk drops significantly |

## Partnership Channel Assessments

| Partner | Opportunity | Status | 6-Week Potential | Action |
|---------|-------------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| **Robertas** (EU Reseller) | Brings European clients, earns commission/markup | Good conversations, needs concrete proposal with defined terms | Realistic if terms proposed this week and agreed within 2 weeks | Draft and send proposal immediately |
| **Rob** (Existing Client) | Expand to ongoing retained/partnership arrangement | Active client, relationship established, deeper terms undefined | Realistic — lowest-friction partnership (relationship exists) | Have expanded partnership conversation this week |
| **Sherrod** (O-1 Visa Platform) | Exploratory | Early stage | Unlikely to generate revenue in time | Maintain relationship, don't invest significant time |
| **AJ / Jacob** | Stalled | AJ enthusiastic but may lack authority; Jacob appears skeptical | Unlikely | One follow-up to gauge reality, then deprioritize |
| **Dan / Erik** (Used Car Dealers) | Post-conference connection | Early | Very unlikely; market analysis suggests limited potential (perfect information, compressed margins) | Deprioritize |

---

## Immediate Next Actions (Week of Feb 14)

1. **Today/Tomorrow:** Draft the Robertas proposal with specific terms. Don't overthink — send something concrete and iterate.
2. **This week:** Have expanded partnership conversation with Rob. Frame: "What would it look like if we worked together on an ongoing basis through Q2?"
3. **This week:** Turn on LinkedIn DM and email outbound systems. Configure for law firm vertical, hourly engagements.
4. **This week:** Send follow-up messages to Sherrod and AJ (one each, low-effort).
5. **This weekend:** Make list of 20 past clients/contacts for network re-activation.
6. **Next Monday:** Start outreach to top 20 network contacts.
7. **Next week:** Talk to friend about Facebook ad basics. Set up first small ad test.
