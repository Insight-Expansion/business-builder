# Target Verticals & Ideal Client Profile (ICP)

**Purpose:** Define who we sell to, why they buy, and how to qualify them. Based on actual successful client engagements and sales conversations.

---

## The AI-Native Agency Thesis

> "Agencies have always been crazy hard to scale. Low margins, slow manual work, and the only way to grow is to add more people. But AI changes this. Now instead of selling software to customers to help them do the work, you can charge way more by using the software yourself and selling them the finished product at 100x the price." — Aaron Epstein

**Why this matters for ICP:** Nexrizen is building the AI-native agency model — using proprietary AI systems internally to deliver at software-company margins. Our ICP should be businesses that want **AI-native transformation delivered to them** (not AI education, not DIY tools). We sell the finished product, not the technology.

**Engagement Model (Feb 2026 Policy):** All new work is **hourly at $120/hr, no exceptions**. The pitch is **"fractional AI/tech team"** — ongoing, flexible, outcome-focused — not one-off fixed-price project delivery.

> See `context/01_ai-native-agencies-aaron-epstein.md` for the full thesis and `Nexrizen_Business_Overview.md` for the hourly-only pricing policy.

- **Geography:** US primary, EU secondary, global opportunistic

### Technographic

## Market Segmentation: Greenfield vs Brownfield (Strategic Clarity)

**Source:** Nick meeting (Nov 2025) - Agency owner with complementary positioning

### The Market Split

| Market Type | Definition | Client Needs | Our Fit | Nick's Fit |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|---------|------------|
| **Greenfield** | New projects, zero to one, rapid prototyping | Speed, MVP validation, low risk | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Perfect | ⚠️ Not their focus |
| **Brownfield** | Existing systems, technical debt, legacy refactoring | Deep expertise, long-term commitment | ⚠️ Possible but slow | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Perfect |

### Nexrizen's Sweet Spot: Greenfield

**Why we win on greenfield:**
- **"3 Days AI" positioning** - Built for speed, not long-term maintenance
- **Proof before payment** - Working demos from project descriptions
- **Automated workflows** - Proposal Builder makes greenfield scalable
- **Senior-only team** - Fast decisions, no handoffs, rapid iteration
- **Risk tolerance** - Willing to experiment with cutting-edge AI tools

**Client profile:**
- Starting from scratch (new product, new process, new automation)
- Need it fast (3-12 weeks, not 6 months)
- Budget flexibility (value speed over lowest cost)
- Decision authority (founder/owner can say yes quickly)

### Why We Avoid Brownfield (Usually)

**Brownfield characteristics:**
- Legacy code maintenance
- Long-term multi-year engagements
- Complex enterprise dependencies
- Slow procurement cycles
- High coordination overhead (committees, approvals, audits)

**Nick's exact words:**
> "You guys are great at greenfield, I'm great at brownfield. There's enough pie for everyone. You build the foundation fast, I come in for the long-term scaling."

### Partnership Opportunity: White-Label Greenfield

**Validated model from Nick meeting:**
- Partner agencies send greenfield rapid projects → Nexrizen
- Nexrizen can work under partner brand (white-label)
- Build MVP foundation for partner's larger projects
- **Complementary, not competitive**

**Example flow:**
1. Client needs new AI feature (greenfield)
2. Partner agency quotes $50K over 6 months
3. Partner sends to Nexrizen for rapid MVP ($6K, 3 weeks)
4. Partner takes MVP for long-term scaling/maintenance

**Win-win:**
- Nexrizen: More greenfield projects (our strength)
- Partner: Happy clients (fast results) + long-term revenue (scaling)

### Strategic Implication for ICP

**Update all targeting to prioritize:**
- ✅ **"Need it fast"** - greenfield projects
- ✅ **"Starting from zero"** - new initiatives
- ✅ **"MVP / POC / pilot"** - validation phase
- ❌ **"Legacy system rewrite"** - brownfield (refer to Nick or similar)
- ❌ **"Long-term maintenance contract"** - not our model (yet)

## Primary Vertical: Personal Injury (PI) Law Firms 🥇

### Why PI is THE #1 Legal Vertical (Gianfranco Validated)
- ✅ **Highest Budgets:** Most money in legal - "cost per acquisition through the roof"
- ✅ **Fastest Decisions:** Think like business people, not traditional lawyers
- ✅ **Marketing-Savvy:** Already spending heavily on ads, understand ROI immediately
- ✅ **Risk-Takers:** More willing to adopt new technology than other legal verticals
- ✅ **Universal Pain:** Intake speed is THE problem - consistent across all PI firms
- ✅ **Proven Market:** Oversaturated but highest spending = more budget for solutions

**Critical Stat (Gianfranco):**
> "Over 60% of people hire the first firm they talk to. In PI, every second matters. Speed is the number one thing."

### Ideal Client Profile
- **Firm Size:** 10-100 employees
- **Practice Area:** Personal injury, mass torts, auto accidents
- **Annual Revenue:** $5M-50M (high-revenue practices)
- **Pain Points:**
  - **Intake speed** - Cost per lead $500-2,000+, can't waste seconds
  - Lead response time (60% hire first responder)
  - Omnichannel marketing (ads everywhere - need to capture all)
  - Case qualification at scale
  - Marketing ROI declining (need better conversion)

### Buying Committee
- **Primary:** Managing Partner / Firm Owner
- **Influencers:** Intake Manager, Marketing Director
- **Budget:** $10-50K projects typical (higher than other legal)

### Sales Triggers
- Cost per client acquisition spiking
- Losing leads to faster competitors
- Expanding marketing (more channels = more chaos)
- New office opening (need systems from day 1)
- Compliance/technology mandate

### Our Unique Value
- Immigration intake system (1,000/day) proves we can handle speed
- Omnichannel expertise (social, web, SMS)
- Real-time AI systems (sales coaching → intake coaching)
- Understanding of legal compliance (bar rules, HIPAA)

### Case Studies to Reference
- Immigration lead qualification (1,000/day production system)
- Omnichannel intake automation
- 24/7 response systems

### Content Themes
- "60% hire the first firm - speed = revenue"
- Intake automation for PI firms
- Omnichannel lead capture
- Marketing ROI optimization

### How to Break In (Gianfranco's Advice)
1. **LinkedIn targeting** - PI lawyers most active on LinkedIn
2. **Webinars** - "AI Intake Automation for PI Firms"
3. **School community funnel** - Free education → paid implementation
4. **Face-to-face meetings** - Get 50-100 conversations to understand nuances
5. **Address decision makers** - "Law firm owners" not "lawyers"
6. **Emphasize speed** - Not features, not tech, just "you'll capture more leads faster"

## Secondary Vertical: Immigration Law Firms

### Why This Vertical?
- ✅ **Deep Expertise:** Wei is Fractional CTO at largest firm in Dallas

- ✅ **Speaking Platform:** AILA conference panels (December)
- ✅ **Network:** Immigration law community
- ✅ **Proven Systems:** 1,000 leads/day qualification in production
- ✅ **Clear ROI:** Compliance + efficiency gains

### ⚠️ MARKET REALITY CHECK (Gianfranco - Legal Marketing Expert)

**Critical Problems:**
- ❌ **Immigration field "under attack"** - lawyers leaving, uncertain future
- ❌ **Tight budgets** - not as much money as other legal verticals
- ❌ **Conservative mindset** - slow to adopt, afraid of technology
- ❌ **Lawyers don't show up** - only office managers attend tech events
- ❌ **Long education cycle** - need to explain everything, hand-hold
- ❌ **Focus on marketing, not operations** - want more leads, not better systems

**Gianfranco's Exact Words:**
> "Immigration now, be careful because a bunch of people are leaving the field because it's under attack. They don't have much money. They're looking more for marketing rather than refining processes."

**Recommendation:**
- Keep immigration as secondary (we have credibility here)

## Anti-ICP: Who We Don't Target

### Company Characteristics
❌ **Pre-revenue startups** (no budget, high risk)
❌ **Enterprise (1,000+ employees)** (procurement hell, not boutique fit)
❌ **Price-sensitive buyers** ("What can you build for $500?")
❌ **"Idea guys"** (no validation, want free R&D)

### Buyer Characteristics
❌ **Assholes** (rude, dismissive, entitled)
❌ **Micromanagers** ("I need daily 2-hour updates")
❌ **Tire kickers** (not serious, just browsing)
❌ **Unrealistic expectations** ("Build me Facebook in 2 days")

### Project Characteristics
❌ **<$2K budget** (not worth our time)
❌ **>6 month timeline** (too long, too risky)
❌ **Unclear scope** (can't extract problem in 30 min call)
❌ **Staff augmentation** ("We need a body for 6 months")

**From Wei's Philosophy:**
> "We don't work with assholes. We've turned down wealthy clients because they were jerks."

## Vertical Prioritization Matrix

### Current State (Pre-Retreat, Updated Feb 2026)

| Vertical | Depth | Demand | Budget | Decision Speed | Priority |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Personal Injury Law** | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 🥇 #1 |
| **Immigration Law** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | 🥈 #2 (credibility, not primary growth) |
| **Construction/RE** | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | 🥉 #3 |
| **Prof Services** | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | #4 |
| **FinTech** | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | 🔮 Future (via Robertas) |

**Why PI moved to #1:** Gianfranco validated that PI lawyers have the highest budgets, fastest decisions, and most willingness to adopt AI. Immigration, while our deepest expertise, is "under attack" with tight budgets and conservative buyers. PI is where the money and speed are.

**Depth:** Our expertise in vertical
**Demand:** Market need + inbound interest
**Budget:** Client willingness/ability to pay
**Decision Speed:** How fast they buy
**Priority:** Where to focus limited resources

### Revenue Channel Context (from Operational Roadmap)

Current revenue by channel — ICP targeting should reflect these dynamics:

| Channel | Revenue Share | ICP Quality | Retreat-Proof? |
|---------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Upwork** | ~70% | Warm, 50% close rate | ❌ No (Wei-dependent) |
| **LinkedIn Inbound** | ~20% | Growing, close rate TBD | ✅ Partially (scheduled content + Gabe handles) |
| **Referrals / Network** | ~10% | Highest quality | ✅ Passive |
| **LinkedIn DM + Email Outbound** | Activating | Systems built, not yet turned on | ✅ Yes (automated, Gabe monitors) |

**Strategic shift:** Move from 70% Upwork to 60%+ non-Upwork channels post-retreat. ICP targeting for outbound should prioritize PI law firms and construction — the verticals most responsive to automated outreach.

## Revenue Model Strategy: What to Sell (Gianfranco Validated)

**Source:** Gianfranco meeting (Feb 2026) - 6 years selling to law firms, legal marketing expert

### Revenue Model Hierarchy (Near-Term Priority)

> "Building software now, it changes too fast. What everyone was doing 2024? AI agents. You create it in one hour webinar for free. The real money is in legal tech guidance." - Gianfranco

| Model | Revenue Potential | Margin | Scalability | Priority |
|-------|------------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| **1. Consultancy/Implementation** 💰💰💰 | Highest per client | 60-80% | Low | 🥇 Now |
| **2. Done-For-You Services** 💰💰 | High volume, recurring | 40-60% | Medium | 🥈 Next |
| **3. Software/Productized Tools** 💰 | Commoditizing fast | 20-40% | High | 🥉 Future |

### What This Means for Sales

**Sell consultancy/guidance, NOT just software:**
- ❌ **Old pitch:** "We'll build you an AI intake system for $10K"
- ✅ **New pitch:** "We'll design your complete AI transformation roadmap, implement the first high-ROI system, and guide you through adoption - $15K implementation + $500-1K/month managed services"

**Why consultancy wins:**
1. **Lawyers want done-for-you, not DIY** - "They want the video recorded and posted, not taught how"
2. **Fear requires hand-holding** - "They're terrified of AI, need guidance at every step"
3. **Software commoditizes quickly** - "Tomorrow it's going to be easier" (tools become free)
4. **Recurring revenue > one-time** - Monthly support contracts = predictable cash flow

### Package Structure (Recommended)

**Tier 1: Discovery & Strategy ($3-5K)**
- AI readiness assessment
- Process analysis
- Technology roadmap
- ROI projections
- Implementation priorities

**Tier 2: Implementation + Training ($10-20K)**
- Build first high-ROI system (intake, case management, etc.)
- Train staff on usage
- Integration with existing tools
- Customization for firm workflows

**Tier 3: Managed Services ($500-$1,000/month)**
- Continuous on-call support
- System optimization
- New feature development
- Priority access (skip waitlist)
- Hosting included

**Upsell Path:**
Free webinar → Discovery & Strategy → Implementation → Managed Services

### Conference Strategy (Nick Validated)

**Nick meeting insight:**
> "Half my first month came from conferences. Face-to-face still matters."

**Conference ROI:**
- **Pre-conference:** LinkedIn outreach to attendees ("Will you be at [conference]?")
- **During conference:** Booth or speaking slot, live demos
- **Post-conference:** Follow-up within 48 hours with POC

**Target conferences:**
- **Legal:** AILA (immigration), PI Marketing Summit, Legal Tech shows
- **Construction:** AGC conventions, restoration conferences
- **General:** Industry-specific trade shows for target verticals

**Why conferences work:**
- Face-to-face builds trust faster than 10 LinkedIn messages
- Decision makers attend (not just staff)
- Captive audience (not competing with email inbox)
- Demonstrate expertise (speaking slot = instant credibility)

## Market Research & Revenue Acceleration Plan (Next 90 Days)

**Source:** Gianfranco meeting - "You need 50-100 conversations to really understand the market"

### Current State Gap

**Conversations so far:** ~12-15 total across all verticals
- Immigration law: ~6-8 firms
- Construction: ~3-4 firms
- PI law: ~1-2 firms
- Other: ~2-3 firms

**Webinar attendance:** 20 registered, 5 showed up (all non-lawyers - office managers)

**The problem:**
> "How many firms have you guys talked to so far? A dozen or so? You need more. You need 50 to 100 at least to have a better understanding. Get FaceTime with them. Offer it for free." - Gianfranco

### Action Plan: 50-100 Face-to-Face Conversations

**Goal:** Get direct decision-maker feedback, not office managers

**Offer:** Free 15-30 minute "AI Strategy Session for [Vertical] Firms"

**Targeting Priority:**
1. **Personal Injury lawyers** (30-40 conversations) - Highest revenue potential
2. **Corporate/Business lawyers** (20-30 conversations) - Second-tier budget
3. **Construction/Field Services** (10-20 conversations) - Validate use cases

**Key Questions to Ask (Every Conversation):**
1. **Identify fear:** "What keeps you up at night about your practice/business?"
2. **Find bottleneck:** "What's your biggest operational bottleneck right now?"
3. **AI experience:** "Have you tried any AI tools? What stopped you or frustrated you?"
4. **Willingness to pay:** "If we could solve [X pain point] in 3 days, would you pay $Y?"
5. **Decision process:** "Who else would be involved in this decision?"

**After every 10 conversations, document:**
- Common pain points (frequency count)
- Objections and fears (exact language)
- Willingness to pay ranges
- Decision-making processes
- Language they use (mirror this in marketing)

### Outreach Channels

**LinkedIn (Primary):**
- Dripify automation for connection requests
- Personalized video messages (Loom)
- Offer free strategy session (no pitch, just learning)
- Ruth executes with proper SOP

**Email (Secondary):**
- Law firm directories (PI firms, immigration firms)
- Email template: "Research for AI adoption in [vertical]"
- Offer Amazon gift card for 30-min call ($25-50)

**Warm Network (Tertiary):**
- AILA contacts (Wei's network)
- Saenz-Garcia referrals
- Past Upwork client referrals

### Timeline & Milestones

**Week 1-2:** Design outreach SOP, create scripts, set up tracking
**Week 3-6:** Execute 25 conversations (PI focus)
**Week 7-10:** Execute 25 conversations (Corporate law focus)
**Week 11-13:** Execute remaining conversations + synthesis

**Success Metrics:**
- 50+ decision-maker conversations completed
- Pain point frequency map created
- Pricing validation complete ($3K/$6K/$10K tiers confirmed or adjusted)
- Messaging framework updated (fear → safety → transformation)
- 5-10 qualified leads generated (side benefit)

### Expected Insights

**Gianfranco's prediction:**
> "If you care to lawyers, you need to speak like lawyers, internalize their pain. Mirror whatever they're feeling. The only way is talking to them more."

**What we'll learn:**
1. **Exact language** they use to describe pain (use in marketing)
2. **Objections** we'll face (prepare responses)
3. **Decision timeline** (how long from interest to purchase)
4. **Budget reality** (what they'll actually pay vs what they say)
5. **Competitor landscape** (who else are they talking to)

### Integration with Sales Pipeline

**Key insight:** These aren't "just research" calls - they're top-of-funnel lead gen

**Conversion path:**
1. Free strategy session (15-30 min)
2. If pain + budget fit → Offer paid Discovery ($3-5K)
3. Discovery → Implementation proposal ($10-20K)
4. Implementation → Managed services ($500-$1K/month)

**Expected conversion:**
- 50 conversations → 10-15 qualified leads → 3-5 closed deals ($30-60K revenue)
- **Research pays for itself** while building market knowledge

## Expansion Strategy (Aligned to Retreat Timeline)

### Phase 1 (Now - Pre-Retreat, Feb 14 - ~Mar 28): PI-First + Retreat Prep
- **Activate PI outreach:** LinkedIn DM + email outbound targeting PI firm decision makers
- **Use immigration credentials** to prove intake speed capability for PI firms
- **Close hourly engagements** to pre-load pipeline before retreat ($120/hr, no fixed-price)
- **Network re-activation:** Reach out to top 20 past clients/contacts
- **Build case studies** for immigration intake (1,000/day) as proof for PI
- **Target:** 5-10 qualified conversations/week within 2 weeks

### Phase 2 (During Retreat, ~Mar 28 - May): Automated + Partnership Channels
- Automated outbound (LinkedIn DM + email) runs without Wei
- Gabe converts warm inbound leads to hourly engagements
- Partnership channels (Robertas, Rob) provide work for engineering team
- **Minimum viable target:** 65% Marta utilization (~105 hrs/mo billable)

### Phase 3 (Post-Retreat, May - June): Product + Scale
- **Build first Claude Code plugin** for law firm vertical (existing workflows → packaged product)
- **Target:** Sellable product within 2-3 weeks of focused effort
- **Test-sell:** $1-2K per unit to webinar audience, school community, past law firm clients
- **Signal test:** If 5-10 organic sales, invest ad budget to scale
- **AILA Texas Fall Conference** for distribution and networking
- Double down on 1-2 best-performing marketing channels from retreat period

### Phase 4 (6-12 months): Vertical Expansion + Fintech
- Expand to construction/field services (post-PI foundation)
- Partner with Robertas for EU fintech deals
- Productize multi-agent orchestration for professional services
- Evaluate: agency growth vs product pivot (see `Strategic_Vision.md` — Open Questions)

### Info Product Buyer ICP (Emerging — Post-Retreat)

**A new buyer profile for the services-to-products transition:**

| Attribute | Service Buyer (Current) | Product Buyer (Emerging) |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Budget** | $10K-50K+ | $1-2K per unit |
| **Engagement** | Custom, hands-on | Self-serve, packaged |
| **Decision speed** | 2-4 weeks | Immediate (impulse at price point) |
| **Volume** | 1-3/month | 5-50/month (scalable) |
| **Channel** | Upwork, LinkedIn, referrals | Webinars, ads, conferences, community |
| **What they buy** | Outcome + implementation | Packaged workflow/template/plugin |

**Proof point:** A comparable seller generated **$32K in two months** selling GitHub repo setups at $1K each — market exists for packaged Claude Code plugins.

> See `Strategic_Vision.md` — "Business Model Evolution" for the full services-to-products spectrum and `Retreat_Operations_Plan.md` — "Post-Retreat Priorities" for the execution timeline.
