# Nexrizen Objection Handling Library

**Purpose:** Document proven responses to common sales objections extracted from Wei's successful sales conversations. Use Wei's exact language when it works, adapt as needed for your style.

---

## How to Use This Document

1. **Don't memorize scripts** - Understand the logic, use your own words
2. **Listen for the real objection** - "It's expensive" might mean "I don't see the value"
3. **Use proof** - Reference case studies, metrics, POCs
4. **Stay calm** - Objections are buying signals, not rejections
5. **Know when to walk away** - Not every lead is a fit

---

## Objection Category 1: COST / PRICING

### Objection 1A: "This is more expensive than I expected"

**Context:** After seeing proposal or discussing pricing

**Wei's Response (Exact Language):**
> "We're ex-Meta, ex-IBM, PhDs—you'd expect us to charge $300-500/hour like other senior engineers. We charge $120-200. Why? Because we've built AI systems that make us 3-4x faster than traditional developers. We pass those savings to you."

**Alternative Response (More detailed breakdown):**
> "Let me show you the breakdown: [X hours] × $120/hr = $[total]. Compare that to offshore teams at $30/hr—sounds cheaper, but they'll take 4-6 months and you'll spend that time managing them. Or compare to US agencies at $300/hr who'll charge you 3x this. We're the sweet spot: senior talent, fast delivery, fair price."

**Follow-Up Questions:**
- "What budget range were you expecting?"
- "What's the cost of NOT solving this problem?" (opportunity cost)
- "Would a phased approach work better?" (split into smaller chunks)

**When to Offer Discount:**
- ✅ If reducing scope (not just asking for cheaper)
- ✅ If annual maintenance contract included
- ✅ If they're a strategic partner/great case study
- ❌ Just because they asked

**Maximum Discount:** 20% (protects team morale and value perception)

---

### Objection 1B: "Can you do it cheaper?"

**Context:** Direct ask for lower price without justification

**Wei's Response:**
> "I could, but I'd have to cut corners—use junior devs, skip testing, reduce features. That's not how we work. What specific part of the scope feels too expensive? Maybe we can adjust what we're building."

**Alternative (If they're price shopping):**
> "Absolutely, you can find cheaper. Upwork, offshore teams, freelancers—lots of options. But here's what you're not getting: PhDs, proven systems that generate real revenue, and a team that builds you a working prototype before you even pay. Speed + quality + senior talent—that's where we're priced."

**Red Flag Response (Walk Away):**
If they say: "Well, someone else quoted me $500 for this"
> "That's a great price—you should work with them. Honestly, if they can deliver quality at that rate, that's a better fit for your budget."

**Why Walk Away:**
- Sets unrealistic expectations
- Will be unhappy customer regardless of delivery
- Undervaluing expertise

---

### Objection 1C: "We have a limited budget"

**Context:** Legitimate budget constraint (not price shopping)

**Wei's Response (Collaborative):**
> "Got it—what's your budget range? Let me see what we can deliver within that. We can do a phased approach: build the core functionality first, add features later as budget allows."

**Follow-Up:**
- Show MVP vs full-feature comparison
- Prioritize must-haves vs nice-to-haves
- Offer maintenance-free first 3 months
- Suggest starting with POC expansion (pay small amount to build out POC)

**Example from Israel Meeting:**
> "If I buy Apple Mini, can you implement the Cloud Code for me?" → Wei: "Sure, bro, let's go."
- Finds creative way to deliver value within constraint
- Builds relationship for future larger projects

---

## Objection Category 2: TRUST / RISK

### Objection 2A: "How do I know you can actually build this?"

**Context:** Skepticism about capabilities

**Wei's Response (THE BEST OBJECTION HANDLER):**
> "You don't have to trust me—let me show you. Send me [specific thing: video, data, requirements], and I'll build you a proof of concept by [next week]. Before you pay anything. If you like what you see, we move forward. If not, you got free work and no hard feelings."

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Removes all risk from buyer
- ✅ Proves capability with actions, not words
- ✅ No competitor does this
- ✅ Creates reciprocity (they feel obligated after free work)

**Wei's Success Rate:** "Conversion goes through the roof" with this approach

**Alternative (If POC not feasible):**
> "Fair question. Let me show you three similar projects we've built: [Case Study 1], [Case Study 2], [Case Study 3]. Here are the live systems, client contacts you can call, and metrics. We also have 50+ production apps shipped—I can show you GitHub, demos, whatever you need."

---

### Objection 2B: "I've been burned by developers before"

**Context:** Previous bad experience with agencies/freelancers

**Wei's Response (Empathetic):**
> "I hear that all the time. That's EXACTLY why we do things differently. Most shops will promise you everything, take your money, then ghost you or deliver junk. We show you working code before you pay a dime. Plus, you're working directly with the founders—no account managers, no junior devs you've never met."

**Dig Deeper:**
- "What happened last time?" (understand their pain)
- "What would make you feel safe this time?" (often it's transparency, communication, milestones)

**Build Trust:**
- Daily standups (visibility)
- Notion access (see live progress)
- Milestone-based payments (not all upfront)
- Contract with clear deliverables

**From Thomas Meeting:**
> Thomas: "I had a local developer... they kind of had the owner who micromanages everything and he's slow. So that makes everyone else slow."
> Wei: "That's why you talk directly to me and Gabe—the people building it, not layers of PMs."

---

### Objection 2C: "This sounds too good to be true"

**Context:** Suspicious of speed/quality/price claims

**Wei's Response:**
> "I get it—most people don't believe us until they see it. That's fair. Look, I'm not asking you to believe me. Schedule a call next week, I'll show you a working proof of concept. If it's bullshit, call me out. But I'm confident enough to build it for free first."

**Proof Points to Reference:**
- "We record and transcribe every client meeting—AI keeps everything in sync"
- "We've built our own AI systems for proposals—5-10 hours reduced to <1 hour"
- "Our engineers are PhDs and ex-Meta—we didn't just learn this stuff last year"

**From Gary Meeting:**
Gary initially skeptical, Wei demonstrated:
- Live demo of Proposal Builder
- Explained Business Builder architecture
- Showed command system, skill system, agent system
> Gary's response: "That's fascinating... I can learn a lot from you"

---

## Objection Category 3: TIMELINE / URGENCY

### Objection 3A: "How long will this actually take?"

**Context:** Questioning timeline claims

**Wei's Response:**
> "Proof of concept in a week. Full build, 3-12 weeks depending on scope. Most dev shops? 6 months minimum. We've invested heavily in our internal AI systems—what used to take months now takes weeks."

**Detailed Breakdown:**
- Week 1: Requirements + Architecture
- Week 2-X: Development sprints (2-week cycles)
- Final week: Testing + Handoff
- Total: 3-12 weeks vs industry 3-6 months

**From Sean Meeting (Restoration AI):**
> Sean: "What would something like this take?"
> Wei: "We can get something built for you within 2 weeks after you sign the contract... Maybe 2-3 weeks max."

---

### Objection 3B: "I need this done faster / slower"

**Context:** Timeline mismatch

**Faster Request:**
> "We can expedite, but it'll require pulling engineers off other projects. That usually adds 20-30% to cost. Alternatively, we can deliver in phases—get the core functionality in [shorter time], add features after."

**Slower Request:**
> "No problem—we can spread it out. That actually helps us since we can smooth resource allocation. Same price, just extended timeline. We'll do milestone check-ins every 2 weeks to keep momentum."

**Red Flag (Unrealistic Urgency):**
If they say: "I need this in 3 days"
> "I can show you a proof of concept in a week, but a production-ready system needs at least [realistic timeline]. Rushing leads to bugs and tech debt. Would you rather have it fast or have it right?"

---

### Objection 3C: "Can you start right away?"

**Context:** High urgency, buyer ready

**Wei's Response:**
> "Yes. Sign the contract today, I'll kick off tomorrow. We'll have a project plan by end of week and first prototype within 2 weeks. How's that sound?"

**Internal Check:**
- Do we have engineering capacity? (Check with team)
- Is this a strategic priority? (May need to deprioritize other work)
- Can we deliver on this promise? (Don't overpromise)

**Prioritization Factors:**
- Deal size (larger deals get priority)
- Strategic value (case study, referral source, great testimonial)
- Technical complexity (can we deliver on aggressive timeline?)

---

## Objection Category 4: TECHNICAL / CAPABILITY

### Objection 4A: "Have you built this specific thing before?"

**Context:** Asking for exact experience match

**Wei's Response (If yes):**
> "Yes—let me show you. [Pulls up case study/demo]. We built this for [Client] in [vertical]. Here's what it does, here's the tech stack, here are the results."

**Wei's Response (If no, but similar):**
> "Not this exact thing, but we've built [similar system]. Same tech stack: [AI/video analysis/whatever]. Here's how we'd approach your version..."

**Wei's Response (If completely new):**
> "Nope, never built this exact thing. But here's why I'm confident: [related experience]. Plus, we'll build you a POC first—if we can't do it, you'll know within a week and you've lost nothing."

**From Zane Meeting (AI Venture Partnership):**
> Zane asking about data annotation business
> Wei pivots: "I'm not someone that digs deep into one thing anymore. I am, at my heart, an entrepreneur and creative engineer who leverages the most advanced AI technology to redesign how business is done."
- Reframes from "have you done this" to "here's our capability"

---

### Objection 4B: "Can your system handle [large scale/complexity]?"

**Context:** Worried about scalability or technical limits

**Wei's Response:**
> "Absolutely. We've built systems that handle [proof point: 7,000 users at Georgia Tech, 1,000 conversations/day for law firm]. Scaling is about architecture—we design for growth from day one."

**Technical Credibility:**
- "I worked on distributed systems at Meta"
- "Our PhD data scientists built genomic processing—terabytes of data per day"
- "We're not building toy prototypes—these are production systems generating real revenue"

**Follow-Up:**
- "What's your expected volume?" (understand their actual needs)
- "When do you expect to hit that scale?" (may not need it day 1)
- "What's your growth trajectory?" (plan for future)

---

### Objection 4C: "We already have a development team"

**Context:** Internal team exists, why hire external?

**Wei's Response:**
> "Perfect—we can work alongside them. We're not here to replace your team. Think of us as specialized expertise: you don't have AI engineers in-house, we do. We build the AI component, hand off the code, your team maintains it. Or we can do a knowledge transfer—train your team on what we built."

**Alternative Positioning:**
> "Your team is probably maxed out on existing work, right? We can handle net-new projects while they keep the lights on. Or we can accelerate a specific initiative that's been on the backlog forever."

**Collaboration Models:**
- Build + hand off
- Build + train their team
- Ongoing partnership (we build AI, they integrate)
- Fractional CTO (Wei/Gabe advise their team)

---

## Objection Category 5: DECISION MAKING

### Objection 5A: "I need to discuss with my team/partners"

**Context:** Not sole decision maker

**Wei's Response (Facilitate):**
> "Totally get it—big decision. What's the best way to help with that conversation? Should I join a call with your team? Can I send materials that explain the technical approach? Or do you just need time to present it internally?"

**Offer to Help:**
- Join team call (answer technical questions)
- Send POC demo recording (they can show others)
- Provide case studies (social proof for team)
- Explain ROI (helps sell internally)

**Timeline:**
- "When do you think you'll have that conversation?"
- "What's your decision timeline?"
- "Is there anything that would speed up the decision?"

**Red Flag:**
If they say "we need to think about it" with no specific timeline or blocker
> This usually means "not interested but too polite to say no"
> Response: "I understand—what specifically are you thinking about? Maybe I can provide more info on that."

---

### Objection 5B: "Let me think about it"

**Context:** Stall tactic or genuine hesitation

**Wei's Response (Probe for Real Objection):**
> "Of course—take the time you need. Can I ask what specifically you're thinking about? Is it the pricing, the timeline, the technical approach? Maybe I can provide more clarity."

**Common Hidden Objections:**
- "Too expensive" → Uncover budget concerns
- "Not sure you can deliver" → Offer POC or more proof
- "Not urgent" → May not close, that's okay
- "Need approval" → See 5A above

**Follow-Up:**
- "When should I check back in?" (set calendar reminder)
- "Is there anything I can send that would help?" (leave door open)
- Don't be pushy (respects their process)

**From Israel Meeting:**
Israel initially cautious, Wei responded with "dating phase" concept:
> "Let's start with 10-20 hours a week, see how we work together. Think of it as dating before marriage."
- Removed commitment pressure
- Israel agreed immediately

---

### Objection 5C: "We're evaluating other options"

**Context:** Shopping around (good! means they're serious)

**Wei's Response (Confident, Not Defensive):**
> "You absolutely should. This is a big investment. Here's what I'd ask them: Will they build you a proof of concept before you pay? Can you talk directly to the engineers building your system? Have they shipped 50+ production apps? If they check those boxes, they're a good option."

**Differentiation Reminders:**
- "We're the only ones building free POCs"
- "Direct founder access—no PMs, no handoffs"
- "Senior engineers only—no offshore junior teams"
- "3-12 week delivery vs industry 6 months"

**Don't Bad-Mouth Competitors:**
- ❌ "Those guys suck"
- ✅ "They're a fine option—here's what makes us different"

**Close:**
> "When you're ready to decide, let me know. I'm confident in what we can deliver, and I'm happy to answer any questions that come up as you evaluate options."

---

## Objection Category 6: SCOPE / REQUIREMENTS

### Objection 6A: "Can you add [feature] without increasing price?"

**Context:** Scope creep during negotiation

**Wei's Response (Firm but Flexible):**
> "I can—but something has to give. We can add [new feature] and remove [existing feature], or we can add it in Phase 2 after the core system is working. Adding it now would increase timeline and cost by [X]."

**Use Proposal Builder:**
- AI can immediately show impact of scope changes
- Update estimate in real-time during call
- Show tradeoffs clearly

**From Thomas Meeting:**
Wei's system handles this automatically:
> "Client reduces scope → AI back-propagates to requirements, forward-propagates to solution architecture"
- Efficient negotiation tool

---

### Objection 6B: "I don't know exactly what I need"

**Context:** Unclear requirements (common!)

**Wei's Response (Discovery Mode):**
> "That's totally normal—most clients don't. That's why we do a discovery process. Tell me about the problem you're trying to solve, and I'll translate that into technical requirements. We'll build a POC so you can SEE what you need, then refine from there."

**Process:**
1. Problem-focused questions (not solution-focused)
2. Current state analysis (how do they do it today?)
3. Ideal outcome (what does success look like?)
4. Build POC based on assumptions
5. Iterate based on feedback

**From Gary Meeting:**
Gary had vague vision, Wei helped crystallize:
> "I want to pull all my content together... books, podcasts, social media"
> Wei: "We'll build a RAG system with metadata, orchestration agents, multiple summary levels..."
- Wei translated vague need into technical solution

---

## Objection Category 7: AUTHORITY / FIT

### Objection 7A: "Are you too busy for my project?"

**Context:** Worried about being deprioritized

**Wei's Response:**
> "Great question. Here's our current capacity: we take on [X] projects at a time, max. Once we commit, you get dedicated engineers and daily standups. I don't overbook—that's how quality suffers. If we're at capacity, I'll tell you and give you a realistic start date."

**Transparency:**
- Show current project load
- Explain resource allocation
- Give realistic timelines
- Don't overpromise availability

---

### Objection 7B: "I need someone available 24/7"

**Context:** Unrealistic availability expectations

**Wei's Response (From Israel Meeting):**
> "Text me at 3am if you want—I'm that invested. But here's the thing: good execution doesn't require constant meetings. We record everything, AI keeps everything in sync, daily standups. You get MORE visibility with LESS of your time."

**Set Expectations:**
- Daily standups (15 min)
- Slack/async communication (respond within 24 hrs)
- Emergency contact for critical issues
- Weekly check-ins (30-60 min)

**Not a Body Shop:**
> "We're not staff augmentation—we're project-based. You're hiring expertise and delivery, not hours. If you need dedicated full-time devs, we're not the right fit."

---

### Objection 7C: "We want to own all the code/IP"

**Context:** IP ownership concerns

**Wei's Response:**
> "Absolutely—all the code we write for your project is yours. That's standard. The only exception is our internal systems (Proposal Builder, our AI frameworks)—those aren't for sale. But everything we build specifically for your project: 100% yours."

**Clarifications:**
- Custom code for their project: ✅ Theirs
- Open-source libraries we use: ✅ Standard licenses apply
- Nexrizen internal tools: ❌ Not transferable
- Knowledge/experience: ❌ Can't be restricted (non-compete not reasonable)

---

## Objection Category 8: INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC

### Objection 8A: "Legal/Healthcare is heavily regulated—can you handle that?"

**Context:** Compliance concerns

**Wei's Response (Legal):**
> "I'm the Fractional CTO at the largest immigration law firm in Dallas. We won the AILA Technology Innovation Award. I'm speaking at the AILA conference. We built a system that qualifies 1,000 leads per day while staying bar-compliant. Compliance is baked into our design—not an afterthought."

**Wei's Response (Healthcare - Less Experience):**
> "We haven't done HIPAA yet, but we have PhDs who've worked in regulated environments (finance, legal). We'd need to bring in a compliance consultant to audit our work—that cost would be included in the proposal. Or we can partner with your existing compliance team."

**Be Honest:**
- If you have experience: lead with it
- If you don't: explain how you'd mitigate risk
- Don't fake expertise in regulated industries

---

## Objection Category 9: PARTNERSHIP / EQUITY

### Objection 9A: "Would you consider equity instead of cash?"

**Context:** Startup wants to preserve cash

**Wei's Response (From Zane and Israel Meetings):**
> "Maybe—depends on the opportunity. Let's do a dating phase first: I'll work hourly for [X weeks], we see how we work together, I see how serious you are about this, you see what I can deliver. Then we can talk about equity, rev share, partnership—whatever makes sense."

**When to Consider Equity:**
- ✅ Strategic partnership (ongoing, not one-off project)
- ✅ Huge market opportunity
- ✅ Strong founding team
- ✅ Clear path to exit/revenue
- ❌ Just trying to get free work
- ❌ No traction, no validation
- ❌ Unclear business model

**Dating Phase Benefits:**
- Proves commitment on both sides
- Generates cash during evaluation
- Reduces risk if it's a bad fit
- Builds relationship before negotiating equity

---

## Objection Category 10: COMPETITIVE / ALTERNATIVES

### Objection 10A: "We're considering building in-house"

**Context:** Weighing build vs buy

**Wei's Response:**
> "That's a great option if you have the time and talent. Here's what you'd need: senior AI engineers ($200K+ each), 6-12 months for first version, ongoing maintenance. We can deliver in 3-12 weeks because we've already built the core systems. Think of us as accelerating 6 months of R&D you'd otherwise do."

**Alternative (If they clearly should build in-house):**
> "Honestly, if this is core to your business and you have the resources, you probably should build in-house. But we can help you get started: fractional CTO engagement, architecture design, then hand off to your team."

---

### Objection 10B: "ChatGPT can do this for free"

**Context:** Misunderstanding AI capabilities

**Wei's Response:**
> "ChatGPT is a tool—like a hammer. Sure, you can build a house with a hammer, or you can hire a carpenter who knows how to use it. We're building production systems: integrations, databases, error handling, security, scalability. ChatGPT can't do that. It's one piece of a much larger system."

**Educate:**
- ChatGPT = AI model (one component)
- Nexrizen = Full system architecture + integration + deployment
- Analogy: "It's like saying 'I have a steering wheel, why do I need a car?'"

---

## "No Asshole" Disqualifiers

**These are NOT objections to overcome—these are signs to walk away:**

❌ **Rude/dismissive tone**
> "You don't know what you're talking about"
> Walk away: "I don't think we're a good fit. Best of luck."

❌ **Unrealistic demands**
> "Build me Facebook for $500 in 2 days"
> Walk away: "That's not feasible. There are freelancers who might claim they can—good luck."

❌ **Bad-mouthing previous vendors excessively**
> "Everyone I've worked with is an idiot"
> Red flag: You'll be next. Walk away.

❌ **Asking for free work beyond POC**
> "Build the whole thing first, then I'll decide if I'll pay"
> Walk away: "That's not how we work. POC is free, full build requires contract."

**Wei's Principle (From Gary Meeting):**
> "We don't work with assholes. We've turned down wealthy clients because they were jerks. Money isn't everything."

---

## Objection Handling Best Practices

### 1. Listen First
- Let them finish
- Don't interrupt with your rebuttal
- Understand the real concern (often deeper than stated)

### 2. Validate Before Responding
> "I totally understand that concern..."
> "That's a fair question..."
> "I hear that a lot, actually..."
- Makes them feel heard
- Reduces defensiveness

### 3. Use Proof, Not Promises
- Case studies > Claims
- Demos > Descriptions
- Metrics > Maybes
> "Let me show you" > "Trust me"

### 4. Ask Questions
> "What specifically concerns you about [timeline/cost/approach]?"
> "What would make you feel comfortable moving forward?"
> "Is there anything else holding you back?"
- Uncovers hidden objections
- Shows you care about their concerns

### 5. Know When to Walk Away
- Some leads aren't a fit
- Protect your team's time and energy
- Bad clients create bad case studies
