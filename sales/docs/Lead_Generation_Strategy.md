# Lead Generation Strategy

**Purpose:** Fill the top of the sales funnel with qualified leads who are pre-sold on the free POC offer. With 75-80% close rates from demo, the bottleneck is awareness — not conversion. Every dollar and hour should go toward getting the right people to see the offer.

---

## Core Insight

Nexrizen's free POC offer is the single strongest lead generation asset in the business. It eliminates buyer risk entirely and converts at 75-80%. The strategy is simple: **get this offer in front of the right people, as fast as possible, in as many places as possible.**

## The Offer (Use Everywhere)

> *"We'll build a working prototype of your app idea — free. Ex-Meta engineers. Georgia Tech PhDs. 50+ apps shipped. Send us your idea, get a working demo in 7 days. Only taking 5 projects this month."*

**Why this works:**
- **Dream fulfillment** — "your idea, built" is what they've wanted for months
- **Risk elimination** — free, no commitment, no call required
- **Credibility stacking** — Meta + Georgia Tech + 50 apps in one sentence
- **Urgency** — "only 5 this month" forces action now

### Offer Variants by Context

## Target Audience

### The Ideal Reader (Cross-Vertical)

**A non-technical business owner who has been thinking about an app or AI system for 3+ months but hasn't started because every option felt too expensive, too risky, or too confusing.**

- Has gotten $50K-$150K quotes from dev shops (or assumes it costs that much)
- May have been burned by offshore teams or bad developers
- Knows they need software/AI but doesn't know where to start
- Has budget authority (founder, owner, managing partner)
- Company size: 10-200 employees

### Priority Verticals (Ranked)

| Rank | Vertical | Why | Key Pain | Entry Point |
|------|----------|-----|----------|-------------|
| **1** | Personal Injury Law | 60% hire first firm they call, high budgets, ROI-driven | Intake speed, lead qualification, CAC rising | AI intake prototype |
| **2** | Construction / Field Services | Paper-based, desperate for apps, validated $100K/mo potential | Manual estimates, crew coordination, documentation | Field services app prototype |
| **3** | Professional Services | Repetitive knowledge work, 1-2 FTE savings proven | Manual operations eating margin | Automation prototype |
| **4** | Funded Startups (Pre-Product) | Seed money, no CTO, need MVP yesterday | No technical cofounder, $10K is pocket change | Full MVP prototype |
| **5** | Healthcare / Insurance | Large orgs, high-value contracts, EU expansion via Robertas | Compliance workflows, patient/claims processing | Workflow automation prototype |

### Exclusions

- Companies with "software" or "technology" in their industry (other dev shops, not buyers)
- Pre-revenue startups without funding (can't pay for production build)
- Enterprise with 6-month procurement cycles (doesn't match our speed)

---

### Vertical Sniper Plays (Quarterly)

#### 8. Industry Conferences — Live POC Builds

**The play:** Attend 1-2 conferences per quarter in top verticals (LegalTech, AILA, construction industry events).

**On-site pitch:**
> "Tell me what app you wish existed for your practice. I'll have a working prototype on your phone before this conference ends."

Then do it. Build a prototype during a break, show it at the evening reception. The story travels the industry for months.

**Cost:** $1-3K per event
**Expected:** 5-10 qualified leads, 3-5 filmable case studies, lasting word-of-mouth

---

## Price Anchoring (Use in All Channels)

The $10K MVP is dramatically underpriced relative to market expectations. Always anchor:

| What They Expect | What We Charge | Frame |
|------------------|---------------|-------|
| $50K-$150K from traditional agency | $10K fixed-price MVP | "1/5th to 1/15th the cost" |
| 6 months delivery | 3-6 weeks | "10x faster" |
| Pay $25-50K upfront before seeing anything | Free prototype first | "Zero risk" |

**Package name:** "The 3-Week MVP Sprint" — fixed scope, fixed price, fixed timeline.
