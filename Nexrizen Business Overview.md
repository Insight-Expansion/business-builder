# **Nexrizen Business Overview**

## **Company Summary**

Nexrizen is an AI consultancy and rapid development firm founded by Wei, specializing in custom software solutions for small businesses. While the company uses "3 Days AI" as a marketing tagline emphasizing speed, actual delivery timelines are 3-12 weeks depending on project complexity \- still faster than most competitors but realistic for full builds. The company has developed deep expertise in the legal sector, particularly immigration law firms.

Wei brings a PhD in data science from Georgia Tech and experience at Meta to the business. He also serves as Fractional CTO at Saenz-Garcia Law, which reinforces the company's credibility in legal tech.

## **Team Structure**

| Role | Person | Responsibilities |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| CEO | Wei | Sales (primarily Upwork), strategy, client relationships, thought leadership |

## **Service Offerings**

Nexrizen operates with different service models depending on the channel:

### **Productized Menu (for outside Upwork \- LinkedIn, referrals, direct)**

1. **Voice AI Bots** \- Automated voice systems for client intake, scheduling, and information delivery  
2. **Custom Dashboards** \- Data visualization and analytics tools, particularly for legal practice management  
3. **Chatbots** \- Conversational AI for client-facing support and internal workflows  
4. **Live Meeting AI Coaching System** \- Real-time AI assistance during meetings for coaching and guidance

These four offerings are being packaged with defined marketing and sales processes for lead generation outside of Upwork.

### **Upwork Projects**

General custom development work \- anything the team can deliver well that isn't overly complex. More opportunistic and varied than the productized menu.

### **Fractional CTO Services**

Both Wei and Gabe sell fractional CTO engagements individually. This provides ongoing strategic technical leadership to clients who need executive-level guidance without a full-time hire.

### **Law Firm Specific: Discovery & Design**

A strategic service for legal practices that includes understanding their current operations and designing a technology roadmap and systems architecture. This positions Nexrizen as a strategic partner rather than just an implementation vendor.

Historical project pricing across all offerings has ranged from $3K to $30K depending on scope.

## **Lead Generation & Sales**

**Current Lead Sources**

* **Upwork (primary)** \- Wei's profile drives the majority of inbound leads. He's selective about which interview requests to accept.  
* **Immigration law firm network** \- Relationship-based referrals from existing legal sector work  
* **LinkedIn (building)** \- Wei and Gabe post daily with VA support to build audience and generate future leads

**Sales Process**

* Upwork leads: Wei handles end-to-end  
* LinkedIn/outside leads: Whoever's profile generated the lead takes the first meeting (Wei or Gabe)  
* No other team members are currently involved in sales

**Strategic Direction**

The company is actively working to reduce Upwork dependency by building marketing and sales processes around the four productized menu items. This will enable lead generation through LinkedIn, referral networks, and potentially other channels.

---

## **Internal Systems & Operations**

Nexrizen is investing heavily in building internal AI-assisted systems for:

* Sales automation  
* Proposal writing  
* Development workflows

These systems are functional and in active use but still under significant development. The investment in these systems is a primary reason for currently thin margins.

The long-term vision includes potentially selling these internal operations, systems, and technology as a separate asset from the agency itself.

## **Financial Position**

| Metric | Current State |
| ----- | ----- |
| Monthly Revenue | \~$10K |
| Margins | Thin (due to internal systems investment) |
| Goal | Increase profitability faster |

---

## **Critical Near-Term Constraint**

Wei will be unavailable for approximately 1.5 months for a silent meditation retreat. Since his Upwork profile generates the majority of leads and he handles most sales, the company has a **2.5-month window** to transition lead generation and sales capacity outside of Upwork before the retreat begins.

This creates urgency around:

* Activating LinkedIn as a reliable lead source  
* Enabling Gabe to handle sales independently  
* Building pipeline that doesn't depend on Wei's daily involvement

---

## **Exit Strategy**

**Timeline:** Approximately 5 years

**Potential Assets to Sell:**

1. **The agency** \- Client relationships, team, recurring revenue, reputation  
2. **Internal systems/tech** \- The AI-assisted operations infrastructure being built for sales, proposals, and development

This dual-asset approach suggests the internal systems work isn't just operational investment but intentional IP development with future value.

---

## **Strengths**

* Faster delivery than most competitors (3-12 weeks vs industry norms)  
* Deep expertise in legal tech, particularly immigration law  
* Strong founder credentials (PhD, Meta, speaking at AILA)  
* Multiple revenue streams (productized services, Upwork projects, fractional CTO, discovery/design)  
* Building proprietary internal systems with potential standalone value  
* Daily content cadence already established on LinkedIn  
* Strategic positioning with law firms through discovery/design offering

## **Challenges & Risks**

* Heavy dependence on Wei for lead generation and sales  
* Upwork dependency for primary lead flow  
* Thin margins limiting runway and hiring capacity  
* 2.5-month deadline to de-risk the retreat period  
* Sales process not yet systematized or delegable beyond Wei and Gabe

---

## **Open Questions for Future Planning**

* Which menu item has the best margin, fastest sales cycle, or highest repeat potential?  
* What pricing and packaging will be attached to each menu item?  
* What revenue target accompanies the profitability goal?  
* What does the sales handoff process look like when Wei is unavailable?  
* How will the internal systems be positioned if sold separately \- as a product, a franchise model, or acquisition target?
